0:00:00.060,0:00:09.980
在1994年九月，日本任天堂開始製作超級馬力歐64。
從最一開始，任天堂就已經做好了一個打算:

0:00:09.980,0:00:18.780
把馬力歐從2D變成3D開啟許多令人興奮的可能性，而其中
最重要的是他最具標誌性的能力:他的跳躍能力

0:00:18.780,0:00:22.000
馬64的跳躍系統做得非常好。

0:00:22.000,0:00:27.460
遊戲在1996年發售的時候一炮而紅，馬上就取得
了巨大的成功。

0:00:27.460,0:00:34.840
圍繞在3D遊戲中前所未見的緊湊且靈敏的操作上，
馬力歐在馬64能使用A鍵做出非常多種動作:

0:00:34.840,0:00:42.780
跳，二段跳，三段跳，帶有星星的三段跳，側空翻，
長跳，蹬牆跳，後空翻，上踢，跳撲!

0:00:42.780,0:00:47.100
所以玩家很自然地就會想:
如果這些動作我們都不用會怎樣?

0:00:55.280,0:01:05.100
(譯者註:為避免疑惑，關卡名會用《》標註，星星名子用【】標註，某些敵人名子不會特別做翻譯)
(0xA代表不使用A鍵，1xA代表這個星星或關卡使用一次A鍵，依此類推)

0:01:08.280,0:01:17.100
(不按)A鍵挑戰的完整歷史
(目前努力翻譯中，目前進度為32分鐘，之後的字幕是英文，有發現錯字請找M99#7944)

0:01:17.280,0:01:22.240
網路世界在90年代末與2000年初是一個神奇的地方，
有如童話故事中那個很遠很遠的王國一樣。

0:01:22.240,0:01:27.060
那個時期大部分的內容已經消失或是被整合進現代的網頁了。

0:01:27.060,0:01:33.240
但有時候還是可以找到一些被保存起來的網頁，供後人參考。

0:01:33.240,0:01:42.700
其中之一是Walton Dell的網站，裡面記錄著各種他
發現或是其他人電郵給他的64主機遊戲小技巧。

0:01:42.700,0:01:45.560
這些之中一些是bug，一些是給讀者的有趣挑戰，

0:01:44.560,0:01:55.420
還有一些就比較無厘頭，像是想像地板上有一張臉，
或是找到12個維京炸彈(bully)??

0:01:55.420,0:02:03.480
直到2000年10月16號，一位匿名的讀者發了一封很長的郵件，
他不會想到這會在接下來的20年掀起多大的熱潮。

0:02:03.480,0:02:11.580
其中有一個挑戰他稱為「不按A鍵挑戰」:
嘗試按最少次A鍵拿到《炸彈戰場》所有的星星。

0:02:11.580,0:02:19.980
雖然郵件裡講得很清楚，因為某些原因，Walton Dell
對要不要把使用大砲的A鍵算進去感到有些困惑。

0:02:19.980,0:02:26.100
他覺得不使用A鍵對【射向空島】來說是不可能的，
因為使用大砲至少一定要按一次A鍵。

0:02:26.100,0:02:30.900
所以他決定把這個A鍵當成一定要按的來算，
於是【射向空島】在他的網站上變成了名義上的0xA。

0:02:30.900,0:02:35.560
然而在郵件中，拿到這個星星的策略寫的很詳細:

0:02:35.560,0:02:39.420
跑到這座橋然後跳下來，使用砸地打開裝有羽毛帽的箱子

0:02:39.420,0:02:44.520
拿到羽毛帽之後，使用大砲(A)往天空發射。

0:02:44.520,0:02:49.860
飛到裝有星星的箱子用砸地打開並拿到星星。
這樣用1xA來射大砲就可以完成【射向空島】。

0:02:49.860,0:02:57.140
有趣的是，郵件中提到一個叫做Myles的人，
但在Walton Dell的網站上這個挑戰被稱為"Alex的挑戰"。

0:02:57.140,0:02:59.700
所以這位匿名讀者到底是誰?

0:02:59.700,0:03:05.340
後來發現是傳奇人物Alex Penev，當時最高產的N64遊戲玩家之一。

0:03:05.340,0:03:10.020
他在馬力歐賽車64的前十年創下了數以百計的世界紀錄，

0:03:10.020,0:03:17.020
並且直到今天還活躍在馬車社群中。
在1999年，社群中的一部分人在使用IRC討論捷徑跟策略。

0:03:17.020,0:03:22.080
雖然大部分的主題圍繞在馬車64，但偶爾也會提到其他遊戲。

0:03:22.080,0:03:28.760
Penev跟Myles Bukrim, Jason Whalls和David Wonn
(David Wonn也有自己的網頁關於N64遊戲的技巧跟bug)

0:03:28.760,0:03:33.980
他們一起創造了許多馬力歐64挑戰，像是:
不吃硬幣，帽子拿星星，不使用大砲拿星星，

0:03:33.980,0:03:35.940
當然其中最重要的就是A鍵挑戰。
(手動校正字幕到這邊)

0:03:35.940,0:03:42.000
Alex的郵件有許多令人驚嘆的細節，
最後都被放上了Walton Dell的網站

0:03:42.000,0:03:46.020
網站也收到了許多跨時代的A鍵挑戰解法。

0:03:46.020,0:03:51.180
舉個例子，在《雪山》中，【雪山八紅幣】在那個時候就已經0xA了。

0:03:51.180,0:03:56.880
其中這個紅幣特別難搞，Jason Whalls發現一個拿到它的聰明策略:

0:03:56.880,0:04:01.920
首先觸發底下的移動平台使它往上。

0:04:01.920,0:04:05.340
然後趕快跑到傳送點讓馬力歐上去山上，
往下跳收集硬幣，前撲並趕上移動平台往下的時間。

0:04:05.340,0:04:10.020
另一個例子，一樣在《雪山》中，【蹬牆跳有用】

0:04:10.020,0:04:15.120
策略是彈到這個spindrift上並按1次A鍵來跳到它的上面，

0:04:15.120,0:04:20.340
並且一直按著它不放。
在空中旋轉時按著A鍵會讓馬力歐下落速度較慢。

0:04:20.340,0:04:25.380
使用這個緩降策略，馬力歐可以只用1xA就收集到這個星星。

0:04:25.380,0:04:33.900
時間不太確定，但是網站收到了另一位讀者的A鍵挑戰。
《雪人島》中，【雪人島八紅幣】

0:04:33.900,0:04:37.800
Dell認為只要騎上龜殼之後一切就很簡單了，但他找不到騎上去的方法。

0:04:37.800,0:04:41.820
所以Dell在網站說0xA是不可能的。

0:04:41.820,0:04:46.380
然而在Penev的郵件中，有詳細提到【旋轉到冰凍池塘】的0xA策略，

0:04:46.380,0:04:49.620
所以很有可能Nathan使用了類似的方法來拿到【雪人島八紅幣】。

0:04:49.620,0:04:56.940
出於某些個人原因，Walton Dell沒有發布更多
Penev在郵件中提到的更多A鍵挑戰。

0:04:56.940,0:05:03.600
這一整年間，這是A鍵挑戰在網路上唯一的紀錄

0:05:04.200,0:05:13.980
但在2001年，一切都改變了。
Chris Oldfield，也叫做humantree，在GameFAQs上發布了
第一個專門紀錄A鍵挑戰的網頁。

0:05:13.980,0:05:18.120
他在網路上記錄了他自己的最少A鍵紀錄。

0:05:18.120,0:05:22.860
而其中一些Alex Penev已經有更好的紀錄，
於是他們就一起在ICQ上交換不同的策略。

0:05:22.860,0:05:28.140
但從一開始大家都忘了一件事:
A鍵挑戰的紀錄都一直以個別星星為單位來計算。

0:05:28.140,0:05:33.600
其中包含每個關卡的【100硬幣星星】。

0:05:33.600,0:05:38.700
Humantree是第一個打破這個規定的人，
他提出了一個問題:

0:05:38.700,0:05:43.140
在一個全新的存檔能夠完全不按A鍵收集有多少星星?

0:05:43.140,0:05:49.020
他全力的使用了當時已知的所有策略，結果他拿到了10顆星星。

0:05:49.020,0:05:54.060
不幸的是，《黑暗世界庫巴(第一個王)》需要1xA才能通關，

0:05:54.060,0:05:58.440
所以Humantree無法到達城堡的其他部分。
另外《鬼屋》要12個星星才會開啟，

0:05:58.440,0:06:02.940
也差一點點就能去了。
於是在只能到4個關卡的前提下，

0:06:02.940,0:06:07.320
他收集了【山頂上的炸彈王】【烏龜賽跑】【射向藍天】

0:06:07.320,0:06:11.340
《雪山》除了【蹬牆跳真的有用】的所有星星，
以及21秒內完成【公主的秘密滑道】。

0:06:11.340,0:06:15.840
當然這些成就到今天只剩下文字紀錄而已。

0:06:15.840,0:06:19.800
Humantree的網站後來就下架了，也沒有頁面存檔可以看。

0:06:19.800,0:06:23.640
這份歷史存在於被遺忘的邊緣，只被少數人記得。

0:06:23.640,0:06:28.860
然後，A鍵挑戰就這樣了。

0:06:28.860,0:06:34.260
在完成了大約30顆星星以及從新存檔拿到10顆星星之後，

0:06:34.260,0:06:38.940
沒有人去研究遊戲其他關卡的A鍵挑戰。
沒有人想過那個最關鍵的問題:

0:06:38.940,0:06:45.180
要通關馬力歐64到底最少需要按幾次A鍵?
許多年過去了，這個問題都沒人解答。

0:06:45.840,0:06:51.240
同一時間，馬力歐64的許多資源仍然持續被產出

0:06:51.240,0:07:00.720
2002年11月，一名GameFAQs活躍用戶用戶，高中學生Curtis Bright
架設了一個網站sm64.com。該網站直至今日都還存在。


0:07:00.720,0:07:06.060
這個網站詳細列出了遊戲中所有硬幣，加命蘑菇，傳送點，秘密道具的位置。

0:07:06.060,0:07:11.520
它也記錄了遊戲中許多限時挑戰的世界紀錄影片，這在當時是前所未見的。

0:07:11.520,0:07:16.800
其中兩個人擁有大部分的紀錄。
他們的名子? Myles Bukrim跟Alex Penev。

0:07:17.400,0:07:22.560
2003年某天，Penev在AIM上寄了一則訊息給Bright。
Penev想要把《雪山》的A鍵挑戰延伸為

0:07:22.560,0:07:28.080
使用1xA拿到關卡中所有的星星。

0:07:28.080,0:07:32.040
這激發了Bright的興趣:
於是他順便研究了其他關卡，包含《炸彈戰場》《Whomp的堡壘》

0:07:32.040,0:07:38.160
《海盜灣》《鬼屋》《火山》《高高山》。

0:07:38.160,0:07:43.980
最終結果是使用了48xA收集了45顆星星。
後來在2005年底，他就在他的網頁開設一個A鍵挑戰專區，

0:07:43.980,0:07:50.580
專門發布他的成績。
可惜，他孤軍奮戰。

0:07:50.580,0:07:57.120
多年來，A鍵挑戰已經山窮水盡，
直到命運中的那天:2007年7月13日。

0:07:57.120,0:08:01.740
在GameFAQs論壇上，一名叫做Kirbymuncher的用戶開了一個新的貼文

0:08:01.740,0:08:06.000
專門討論A鍵挑戰。
Curtis Bright是前幾個參與討論的人。

0:08:06.000,0:08:09.780
他提到了另一個巴西玩家有開設一個自己的紀錄網站。

0:08:09.780,0:08:13.680
網站上研究了更多星星的A鍵數量。
這個巴西玩家叫做Thiago Trujillo。

0:08:13.680,0:08:17.340
他們發現Thiago嘗試了非常多的星星。

0:08:17.340,0:08:21.000
事實上，在該貼文發布的兩個月前，他就已經

0:08:21.000,0:08:22.717
用244xA收集了112顆星星。
然而許多他的紀錄不是最佳的:

0:08:22.717,0:08:23.280
Curtis Bright在6個星星上比Thiago做的更好，
兩人紀錄合併起來使用了230xA收集了112顆星星。

0:08:23.280,0:08:28.920
這個時候，N64模擬器已經越來越流行，
由於可以隨時存檔的功能，許多人更少的A鍵

0:08:28.920,0:08:34.080
在容易失誤的地方拿到星星。

0:08:34.080,0:08:39.300
Bright覺得他應該要做兩個世界紀錄列表，把RTA(人類玩家)
與TAS(電腦輔助)的紀錄分開，這樣才公平。

0:08:39.300,0:08:44.700
其中一名TAS玩家是bobmario511，他發現了許多聰明的
方法來減少許多星星的A鍵使用數量。

0:08:44.700,0:08:49.080
其中最讓人印象深刻的點是他14年前貼的影片到現在還看的到。

0:08:49.080,0:08:54.900
事實上他貼了超過100個影片。

0:08:54.900,0:08:58.740
現在只剩少數幾個星星還沒被研究過，
主要在《時鐘塔》《彩虹毯》

0:08:58.740,0:09:01.920
《天上的庫巴(第三隻王)》以及【可怕的港口100硬幣】

0:09:01.920,0:09:06.240
這些星星被認為實在是過於困難，至少要10xA才能拿到。

0:09:06.780,0:09:11.160
在此同時，Curtis Bright實現了他的想法。
他更新了他的網站，

0:09:11.160,0:09:15.180
加入了另一個紀錄表，把RTA跟TAS分開。
人們可以把自己的影片紀錄傳給他。

0:09:15.180,0:09:20.460
在這些紀錄中有Bright自己的，bobmario511

0:09:20.460,0:09:25.860
Thiago Trujillo，也有許多較不知名的玩家像是
EnNopp112, SilentSlayers, sonicpacker以及Robert Z等等。

0:09:25.860,0:09:31.320
非常可惜的是這些人之後就再也沒做出什麼重要的貢獻。
(這句是一個玩笑,sonicpacker是TAS界的大佬)

0:09:31.320,0:09:35.760
最早的遊戲總A鍵使用量便是從Curtis Bright的網站來的。

0:09:35.760,0:09:43.920
在2008年6月12日，總共需要用到217xA來收集全部120顆星星。

0:09:43.920,0:09:49.080
但這邊有兩個要注意的點。
首先，好消息:所有星星都是分開計算的。

0:09:49.080,0:09:55.080
然後是壞消息:所有星星都是分開計算的。

0:09:55.080,0:09:58.920
因為拿到每一關的【100硬幣星星】不會把馬力歐給踢出關卡，
如果把它跟關卡裡的其他星星一起收集，

0:09:58.920,0:10:04.020
就可以合計省下更多A鍵使用量。

0:10:04.020,0:10:08.820
這邊稍微估計一下，大約可以省下12到15個A。

0:10:08.820,0:10:13.980
但是那個時後，沒人考慮過完整的120星星路線，
並且在不完整的資料下，

0:10:13.980,0:10:18.600
要客觀的給出一個明確的A鍵使用量數字是不可能的。

0:10:18.600,0:10:23.400
所以我們現在先把這些應該可以省下來的A鍵加回來。

0:10:23.400,0:10:28.080
然而這個數字並不包含在城堡裡移動以及進入關卡所需的A鍵。


0:10:28.080,0:10:33.360
《秘密水族箱》《迷宮洞窟》《鋼鐵帽》各需要1xA進入。

0:10:33.360,0:10:37.860
《彩虹飛毯》《飛越彩虹的馬力歐》《消失帽》跟《天上的庫巴》各需要2xA。


0:10:37.860,0:10:43.080
最後《大小島》《時鐘塔》每次進去都需要1xA，

0:10:43.080,0:10:48.540
總共需要多按23次A鍵。
於是最早的完整紀錄是240xA。

0:10:48.540,0:10:53.820
在2008年6月，另一名TAS玩家alkhdaniel

0:10:53.820,0:10:56.460
在時鐘塔裡面省了6個A鍵，

0:10:56.460,0:11:01.200
把總A鍵數減到了234，
他的影片沒有多少人發現，

0:11:01.200,0:11:05.880
像是這個關於【時鐘塔100硬幣】的影片只有一個
來自這個無知玩家的留言。(你是怎麼不按A上踢的?)

0:11:05.880,0:11:10.140
有了紀錄版，一篇反應熱烈的GameFAQs貼文

0:11:10.140,0:11:14.460
工具輔助紀錄的出現，以及有關每一個星星A鍵的紀錄，

0:11:14.460,0:11:18.900
A鍵挑戰終於進入了黃金時期。

0:11:18.900,0:11:25.380
減少通關遊戲所需的A鍵數量--任務正式開始了。

0:11:25.380,0:11:28.200
隨後的進展簡直不可思議(...?)

0:11:38.940,0:11:44.280
Curtis Bright的網頁從未真正流行起來。
接下來3年，有大約30個不同的人發布到網站上，

0:11:44.280,0:11:48.300
但是其實紀錄沒有任何進展。

0:11:49.260,0:11:54.840
那篇GameFAQs的貼文在幾個月之後就沒人回復了，停在了300個回復。

0:11:54.840,0:11:57.120
玩家沒有繼續減少A鍵的使用量，大家都覺得這個挑戰已經被解決了。

0:11:58.140,0:12:07.560
過了整整三年才終於有了新的進展。

0:12:07.560,0:12:10.920
這個進展來自出乎意料的地方，取得了光榮的成就。

0:12:24.420,0:12:37.140
不按20A鍵拿到20顆星星。
同樣的，因為《黑暗世界的庫巴》需要1xA，

0:12:37.140,0:12:42.300
所以去不了城堡的其他地方。
這個TAS是由一群日本TAS玩家在2011創造的。

0:12:42.300,0:12:48.180
當它在3月發布到YouTube的時候，引發了軒然大波:

0:12:48.180,0:12:52.620
6天就達成了7萬8000次觀看。
許多文章記錄了它的成就。

0:12:52.620,0:12:56.640
不幸的是，這個TAS的生產過程並不清楚，因為作者們
現在也不記得它的細節了。

0:12:56.640,0:13:01.560
但這個確實啟發了另一個日本TAS玩家，

0:13:01.560,0:13:06.120
他找到了《海盜灣》【掠奪沈船】的進展，不按A收集它以及

0:13:06.120,0:13:10.740
《海盜灣》第二個星星，把全新存檔的不按A星星數量提升到22。

0:13:11.460,0:13:17.220
然後，就這樣了。
A鍵挑戰在接下來的兩年半中被世人遺忘了

0:13:18.060,0:13:22.740
但是這個沉寂期是特別的:
這是最後一個。

0:13:23.640,0:13:29.280
在2013年8月25日，一名意想不到的人重新出現了。

0:13:29.280,0:13:34.260
還記得那個五年前出現的無知玩家嗎?
他是pannenkoek2012。

0:13:35.640,0:13:41.340
在接下來的幾年之後，他的成就是如此地具有革命性，如此的

0:13:41.340,0:13:46.800
令人難以置信，只憑他一個人就把A鍵挑戰昇華到了無人能想像的高度。

0:14:00.960,0:14:08.820
這裡是當時收集所有120顆星星所需最少的A鍵數量。

0:14:08.820,0:14:14.220
總共有208xA。
某些早期的關卡已經幾乎不需要A了，但是後面的關卡

0:14:14.220,0:14:18.960
尤其是垂直高度很大的《時鐘塔》，簡直是完全的噩夢。

0:14:18.960,0:14:24.240
但是這一切都即將改變，一場革命即將發生。
在短短的兩年之中，幾乎所有的A鍵使用都將消失。

0:14:29.520,0:14:34.740
Pannenkoek2012原本只是這個遊戲影片的觀眾，

0:14:34.740,0:14:39.300
但他從2010年開始製作一些拿到關卡內所有金幣的影片，
獲得了一些關注。

0:14:39.300,0:14:45.300
但在一些關卡中，他拿到的金幣數量是遊戲的顯示上限255個，

0:14:45.300,0:14:49.860
比關卡中原本的金幣總量多很多。
他使用了一種當時連他都還不太了解的複雜技巧。

0:14:49.860,0:14:54.720
不幸的是，那些影片的畫質相當地低:

0:14:54.720,0:14:58.740
當時他是用一些免費試用版的螢幕錄製軟體錄影Project 64(N64模擬器)。

0:14:58.740,0:15:03.960
這讓影片畫質非常糟糕，但跟當時其他的影片比起來還算好的了。

0:15:03.960,0:15:09.780
時間是2013年，他覺得他已經把每一關的最大硬幣量弄清楚了，

0:15:09.780,0:15:14.880
所以他決定研究新的議題。
他開始研究遊戲中各種的bug，

0:15:14.880,0:15:19.080
用影片紀錄他的各種發現。
直到某天，他感覺到他的知識量足夠嘗試A鍵挑戰了。

0:15:19.080,0:15:24.840
從8月25號開始，他發布了一連串的影片，紀錄遊戲中

0:15:24.840,0:15:30.240
拿到每一個星星的所需A鍵數量。

0:15:30.240,0:15:35.640
最一開始的幾個影片包括兩個《炸彈戰場》的星星，
【射向天空】跟【8紅幣】。

0:15:35.640,0:15:40.440
這兩個星星的要解決的主要問題在如何不按A到空島上，

0:15:40.440,0:15:45.540
而他使用的策略可以是前所未見的。

0:15:45.540,0:15:51.060
當其他人都在玩沙的時候，Pannenkoek已經在蓋大樓了。

0:15:51.060,0:15:57.120
他一出手就驚天動地，天才的程度甚至讓他有了自己的維基百科條目。
這是名為「克隆」的藝術。

0:16:01.380,0:16:05.640
很自然地，Pannenkoek第一個技術突破是使用

0:16:05.640,0:16:10.080
他花了很多年在刷金幣精通的bug。

0:16:10.080,0:16:14.220
在我們看他變魔術以前，需要先了解「克隆」，也就是複製物品，這個bug
到底是怎麼運作的。

0:16:14.220,0:16:19.140
各位做好準備，現在是上一堂遊戲物理課的時間了。

0:16:22.020,0:16:26.940
注意事項；這邊會有一點長，但我不推薦跳過這段。

0:16:26.940,0:16:31.860
「克隆」可能是A鍵挑戰直至今日為止最最重要的一個技巧，

0:16:31.860,0:16:35.820
如果不了解它的運作原理可能會讓你後面很大一部分搞不懂。

0:16:35.820,0:16:39.780
那麼請翻開課本，我們開始上課吧。

0:16:42.240,0:16:49.500
在開始以前，我要說一下其實Pannenkoek的頻道已經
有很詳細的影片教學了

0:16:49.500,0:16:58.620
事實上，這個影片幾乎所有的遊戲運作原理都是
從他的影片整理出來的。

0:16:58.620,0:17:02.100
我會在影片畫面下方做編號註記，提供一些更完整的解釋。

0:17:02.100,0:17:06.420
在影片的說明欄裡面有所有的註解跟專有名詞列表。

0:17:06.420,0:17:10.260
並且如果提到一些先前講過的機制，會有時間註記

0:17:10.260,0:17:13.920
讓你忘記的話可以回去複習一下。

0:17:13.920,0:17:24.240
「克隆」源自於馬力歐在拿起物品的時候，他手中你看到的物品
其實是原本物品的複製品。

0:17:24.240,0:17:29.820
原本的物品在馬力歐放開它以前都會是隱形且通常無法接觸。

0:17:29.820,0:17:34.740
讓我們稱呼它們為「原物」跟「手中物」。
因為原物其實還存在並且有被載入，

0:17:34.740,0:17:39.540
它只是沒辦法跟馬力歐互動，我們稱它處於「停滯」狀態。

0:17:39.540,0:17:44.640
遊戲還是會更新它的動畫資料，只是不會顯示它。

0:17:44.640,0:17:49.140
在此同時，手中物的影像會根據三個資料產生:
遊戲會追蹤它的位置；

0:17:49.140,0:17:53.340
手中物的旋轉角度跟馬力歐的角度一樣；
而它的動畫則隨原物的狀態變化。

0:17:53.340,0:17:58.080
根據原物的不同，它的位置也可能改變。

0:17:58.080,0:18:03.540
有些會留在原處；有些會跟著馬力歐移動或跟在他附近。

0:18:03.540,0:18:09.240
一個有趣的例子是炸彈:
馬力歐拿起炸彈的時候引線會被點燃，

0:18:09.240,0:18:15.000
於是我們可以看到冒煙的特效。
因為手中物只是複製影像而已，它其實不會產生冒煙的特效。

0:18:15.000,0:18:20.520
我們看得的煙霧是從原物來的:
原本(隱形的)炸彈的位置會跟著複製影像一起移動

0:18:20.520,0:18:24.720
使得煙霧看起來像是從複製影像冒出來的。

0:18:24.720,0:18:30.000
另外，炸彈是原物在被抓住的時候，
馬力歐還是能跟它接觸的一個少數例外。

0:18:30.000,0:18:35.160
這造成了膨脹炸彈的bug。
在炸彈爆炸的幾幀前，

0:18:35.160,0:18:40.140
炸彈會明顯的膨脹。
如果馬力歐在對的時間抓住它，

0:18:40.140,0:18:44.700
他就可以抓住一顆膨脹的炸彈。
馬力歐就會被膨脹的炸彈往後推動，

0:18:44.700,0:18:49.140
並且只要馬力歐不放開它，那顆炸彈就會一直跟著他移動。

0:18:49.140,0:18:54.900
但是如果馬力歐在炸彈爆炸的同時抓住它會怎樣?
這裡就是事情開始變好玩的地方了。

0:18:54.900,0:19:00.720
但在那之前，我們要先講講抓住跟放開物品到底是怎麼運作的。

0:19:00.720,0:19:06.120
當馬力歐抓住一個物品，遊戲會檢查一些東西。
首先，遊戲會把那個物品標記為馬力歐要抓的對象。

0:19:06.120,0:19:10.040
然後馬力歐會被設定成有拿著東西的狀態，

0:19:10.040,0:19:15.780
並且那個物品會被設定成被拿著的狀態。
在多數情況下，同時把原物改成隱形且無法接觸的狀態。

0:19:15.780,0:19:20.340
為了讓整個過程可以正常運作，馬力歐必須要能跟

0:19:20.340,0:19:24.780
原物有某種聯繫，不然在停滯狀態的原物就永遠沒辦法被拿回來了。

0:19:24.780,0:19:30.360
遊戲使用一種非常簡單的系統來處理這個過程。
每個物品在載入的時候

0:19:30.360,0:19:36.360
都會占用240個物品欄中第一個空位。
雖然事實上物品欄的記憶體位置看起來像這樣，

0:19:36.360,0:19:40.260
為了讓事情簡單一點，我們直接給每個物品

0:19:40.260,0:19:45.900
1到240的編號。
當馬力歐抓起一個物品，原物會被改成停滯狀態，

0:19:45.900,0:19:50.940
馬力歐則會拿到連結到原物的物品編號。
那個物品編號存在馬力歐的手中物，

0:19:50.940,0:19:55.920
也就是原物的複製影像。
手中物只要有原物的物品編號，遊戲就可以運作。

0:19:55.920,0:20:01.020
而只要馬力歐拿著手中物，原物就會維持載入(雖然是停滯狀態)。

0:20:01.020,0:20:06.300
當馬力歐放開物品，不管是丟出還是放下，

0:20:06.300,0:20:10.680
遊戲會檢查物品編號，然後把停滯狀態的原物叫出來。

0:20:10.680,0:20:17.540
但是要記得，遊戲不會更新原物在停滯狀態的位置，
所以它跟被馬力歐拿著到處跑的手中物的位置基本上不一樣了。

0:20:17.540,0:20:25.440
當原物從停滯被叫回來，它的位置必須更新到手中物最後的位置。

0:20:25.440,0:20:30.420
這個用三個參數XYZ儲存的位置剛好就叫做手中物最後的位置，或簡稱HOLP。

0:20:30.420,0:20:35.160
當馬力歐拿著一個物品，HOLP會隨時更新到馬力歐手的座標，

0:20:35.160,0:20:39.420
而當馬力歐放開物品，原物會馬上被傳送到HOLP，

0:20:39.420,0:20:45.240
並且複製影像消失。
這邊有一個小但關鍵的細節:

0:20:45.240,0:20:49.920
為了讓整個過程看起來順暢，原物並不會剛好被傳送到HOLP。

0:20:49.920,0:20:54.240
根據馬力歐的位置而定，像是如果馬力歐在地上放開物品，
原物會被送到HOLP的水平位置，

0:20:54.240,0:20:58.320
但是垂直位置則是使用馬力歐的位置，
看起來就像是馬力歐把東西放在地上。

0:20:58.320,0:21:04.380
多數時候，這整個過程都很順暢且沒什麼問題。

0:21:04.380,0:21:08.700
但它並非滴水不漏，並且裡面的小漏洞剛好大到讓一些
聰明細心的玩家把它整個玩壞。

0:21:08.700,0:21:14.460
還記得當馬力歐抓住一個物品，馬力歐跟物品會分別切換狀態，

0:21:14.460,0:21:19.560
並且由手中物的編號做連結。

0:21:19.560,0:21:25.140
在前撲抓跟手中抓物品的時候，所有事情都會同時發生。

0:21:25.140,0:21:29.760
但如果是站抓物品，遊戲會在實際切換狀態前兩幀發出切換的訊號。

0:21:29.760,0:21:34.500
假如原物這兩幀的空檔取消載入，我們就可以做一些有趣的事。

0:21:34.500,0:21:39.000
有幾個方法可以讓這件事發生:
最常見的方法是把一個箱子放置30秒

0:21:39.000,0:21:43.500
並在它取消載入前的最後兩幀抓住它，
或是在炸彈爆炸的同時抓住它。

0:21:43.500,0:21:48.960
任何能讓原物在馬力歐站抓的那兩幀取消載入的方法都可以達成這個效果，

0:21:48.960,0:21:57.420
像是通過載入點，
一個遊戲負責取消載入部分地圖並載入新地圖的觸發點。

0:21:57.960,0:22:02.400
遊戲不會更新取消載入的物品，代表原物不會進入停滯狀態。
(不會被標記成被抓的狀態)

0:22:02.400,0:22:07.620
但是馬力歐還是會由手中物拿到一個物品編號，

0:22:07.620,0:22:11.580
而這個手中物現在連結到一個空的物品欄位，

0:22:11.580,0:22:16.560
它可以載入任何新的物品。
由於空的物品欄位裡面沒有東西，

0:22:16.560,0:22:21.060
馬力歐的手中物看起來便是隱形或是凍結的，

0:22:21.060,0:22:25.500
這反應了原物在被取消載入前的最後狀態。

0:22:25.500,0:22:29.940
當新的物品被載入到那個物品欄，
手中物便連結到一個全新的物品，跟原本抓的東西完全沒關係。

0:22:29.940,0:22:34.980
這看起來像是我們成功「克隆」了那個新的物品，

0:22:34.980,0:22:39.480
但其實還沒成功。
馬力歐只是拿著那個物品的編號(複製影像)

0:22:39.480,0:22:41.640
而因為原物沒被設成停滯狀態(隱形的)，

0:22:41.640,0:22:46.440
看起來才會像是同時有這兩個物品。
但如果馬力歐把拿著的物品丟出去，

0:22:46.440,0:22:50.700
我們可以看到複製影像就會消失，並且原物被傳送到馬力歐附近。

0:22:51.360,0:22:56.940
但如果那個新的物品是不能被丟出去的，像是蘑菇，會發生什麼事情?

0:22:56.940,0:23:01.740
每一個可以抓的物品都有一段程式處理它被抓，放下跟丟出去的反應。

0:23:01.740,0:23:06.420
如果新的那個物品沒有這段程式，它被丟出去的時候什麼都不會做。

0:23:06.420,0:23:11.340
原物的行為程式會被刪除，使它的功能再也不能正常運作。
基本上它會卡在同一個地方不動。

0:23:11.340,0:23:17.040
當被克隆的物品有產生器的時候這會有很重要的作用。

0:23:17.040,0:23:21.480
產生器是用來管理一群物品載入跟取消載入的東西，

0:23:21.480,0:23:26.280
這些物品包括一線硬幣，一圈硬幣，蘑菇三人組等等。

0:23:26.280,0:23:30.960
當馬力歐離那個壞掉的蘑菇一段距離，它還是會被載入，
但是產生器不會收到訊號，

0:23:30.960,0:23:35.100
所以雖然舊的蘑菇還在，

0:23:35.100,0:23:39.600
產生器還是會正常載入新的蘑菇，
這樣就成功克隆這個蘑菇了。

0:23:40.140,0:23:44.940
因為這個過程會把被克隆物品的行為程式刪除，

0:23:44.940,0:23:50.280
克隆有一些限制。
首先，被克隆的物品必須要有產生器，不然它就只能被搬運。

0:23:50.280,0:23:55.140
這還是很有用，並且就算那個物品最後沒有被複製，

0:23:55.140,0:24:00.360
我們通常還是會把這個技巧叫做克隆。

0:24:00.360,0:24:04.980
但最大的限制便是克隆出來的物品沒辦法像原物一樣移動或是做它應該做的事。

0:24:04.980,0:24:10.260
幸運的是，馬力歐跟物品的互動跟它的行為程式不直接相關，

0:24:10.260,0:24:15.600
所以馬力歐還是可以跟克隆出來的物品互動。

0:24:15.600,0:24:20.760
不幸的是，互動過後的物品會經由它的行為程式處理，
所以馬力歐跟克隆出來的物品接觸一次後，

0:24:20.760,0:24:27.420
處理跟它互動的程式就會壞掉。
所以雖然馬力歐可以接觸克隆出來的物品，但他只能接觸他一次。

0:24:27.420,0:24:32.340
舉個例子，丟出一個硬幣克隆會讓馬力歐收集它，但同時也會
讓它卡在空中，無法再次收集。

0:24:32.340,0:24:37.260
丟出一個蘑菇克隆會讓馬力歐馬上被它擊退，

0:24:37.260,0:24:42.120
之後它就會凍結在空中且無法接觸，讓這個蘑菇克隆
變得完全沒有用處。

0:24:42.120,0:24:47.160
還好還是有變通辦法。如果馬力歐在掉落地夠快時丟出

0:24:47.160,0:24:51.180
蘑菇克隆，馬力歐會在他放開克隆時離開它的互動範圍，
他們就不會撞在一起。

0:24:51.180,0:24:56.220
之後馬力歐就可以回來在踩他一次，就一次。

0:24:56.220,0:25:01.560
所以Pannenkoek其實只要克隆一些蘑菇，掉落時把它們丟出，

0:25:01.560,0:25:07.680
之後再回來踩在它們身上彈跳到空島上就好了?
沒那麼簡單。還有一個大問題，

0:25:07.680,0:25:12.900
丟出物品克隆的時候，被克隆的物品必須要離馬力歐丟出時的距離
足夠地近，讓那個物品保持載入。

0:25:12.900,0:25:16.920
不像停滯狀態的物品，只要馬力歐還抓著它就會被強制維持載入狀態，

0:25:16.920,0:25:21.480
克隆物不會被強制維持載入，所以馬力歐離開它的產生器一段距離後，

0:25:21.480,0:25:26.580
克隆物就會被取消載入。
雖然在這裡蘑菇三人組可以維持載入，

0:25:26.580,0:25:31.920
但在那裏就不能了。
這邊就需要另外一個新的技術:遠端釋放。

0:25:32.640,0:25:37.260
感覺像兩個小時前我有提到手中物的最後位置會

0:25:37.260,0:25:41.400
根據馬力歐的位置更新，但其實有方法可以防止它更新。

0:25:41.400,0:25:45.660
有一些方法可以做到這件事，但是這邊

0:25:45.660,0:25:50.760
我們要提的是手中帽子bug。
馬力歐戴上帽子的動畫有兩個階段:

0:25:50.760,0:25:55.140
在第一階段，馬力歐把帽子拿在它的手上，
第二階段帽子就會到他的頭上。

0:25:55.140,0:26:00.360
馬力歐撿到帽子的時候就會觸發第一階段:

0:26:00.360,0:26:05.280
馬力歐拿著帽子，同時播放動畫。
這個時候如果馬力歐檢到第二個帽子，

0:26:05.280,0:26:09.480
動畫第一階段播完的時候就會開始播第二階段，但是動畫的時間不會被重設。

0:26:09.480,0:26:14.220
結果就是第二階段會被打斷，馬力歐最後則會拿著帽子在手上。

0:26:14.220,0:26:18.900
要短時間內戴上兩次帽子可以用傳送點複製帽子，

0:26:18.900,0:26:24.480
或是在舊的帽子消失之前再使用一次帽子箱。

0:26:24.480,0:26:30.600
這個bug對HOLP有重要的影響，如果馬力歐在手中帽的狀態下

0:26:30.600,0:26:34.620
抓住一個物品，那個物品還是會被正常的抓住，
但馬力歐看起來只會抓著他的帽子。

0:26:34.620,0:26:39.900
因為馬力歐手中物的動畫沒有顯示，HOLP的位置就不會正常更新。

0:26:39.900,0:26:44.880
這就造成HOLP的位置跟馬力歐的位置分開來了，而HOLP的位置
就停在最後它被更新的位置。

0:26:44.880,0:26:51.240
舉例，馬力歐在這邊放開一個箱子，然後使用手中帽bug丟出一個炸彈，

0:26:51.240,0:26:55.080
那個炸彈會被送到馬力歐放開箱子的那個位置，

0:26:55.080,0:27:00.060
因為遊戲認為HOLP在那個地方。
這就是遠端釋放。

0:27:01.380,0:27:06.420
雖然有很多複雜的操作跟問題，但這就是Pannenkoek不使用A鍵

0:27:06.420,0:27:11.160
就到《炸彈戰場》的空島上去的方法。
首先，他抓住一個爆炸中的炸彈，

0:27:11.160,0:27:16.200
拿到一個空的物品欄位。
然後他拿著這個欄位一直到這個位置

0:27:16.200,0:27:21.000
放開它把HOLP設定在半空中。
然後他用手中帽bug跟另一個炸彈

0:27:21.000,0:27:26.760
從蘑菇三人組複製一個蘑菇。
用遠端釋放，他把蘑菇傳送到HOLP，

0:27:26.760,0:27:31.920
然後他就可以過去在踩它。
但是一個蘑菇彈跳不夠，

0:27:31.920,0:27:36.720
他需要更多蘑菇來蓋一座到空島的橋。
問題就在這裡，為了把蘑菇放到更遠的地方，

0:27:36.720,0:27:41.280
HOLP必須要在更遠的地方，代表馬力歐先要能到那個地方，

0:27:41.280,0:27:46.500
所以他要先踩這個蘑菇彈跳過去才能放新的蘑菇。

0:27:46.500,0:27:51.060
但要記得，蘑菇克隆只能互動一次，所以馬力歐在上面彈跳放第二個蘑菇的時候，

0:27:51.060,0:27:55.200
第一個蘑菇就沒辦法用了。
所以放完第二個蘑菇後，

0:27:55.200,0:27:59.700
馬力歐要回來在第一個蘑菇旁邊放第三個蘑菇才能彈到第二個蘑菇上。

0:27:59.700,0:28:04.320
這個過程在橋越來越長的時候會指數成長。

0:28:04.320,0:28:09.120
這有點像是用二進位數數，1是你放的蘑菇，0是準備要放蘑菇的位置。

0:28:09.120,0:28:13.740
橋的長度是所需的1的長度。

0:28:13.740,0:28:19.260
所以一個蘑菇長的橋需要一個蘑菇。

0:28:19.260,0:28:25.560
兩個蘑菇長的需要3個，三個蘑菇長的需要7個,四個蘑菇長的需要15個。

0:28:25.560,0:28:30.120
n個蘑菇長橋的就需要二的n次方-1個蘑菇。
這會造成一些問題，

0:28:30.120,0:28:34.140
因為畫面上如果有超過大概40個蘑菇遊戲就會閃退。

0:28:34.140,0:28:39.420
所以最長能蓋出的蘑菇橋大約只有5個蘑菇長。

0:28:39.420,0:28:43.740
在空島的例子，Pannen用3個蘑菇長的橋，也就是7個蘑菇，

0:28:43.740,0:28:48.360
來彈跳過去空島。要拿到紅幣到空島上就好了，

0:28:48.360,0:28:52.560
但這個星星還要做一些事情才能拿到。

0:28:52.560,0:28:57.960
如果能用蘑菇彈上去就能拿到星星。
有兩個方法可以做到這件事:

0:28:57.960,0:29:02.160
第一個是用同樣的策略:
把HOLP放到星星下面，在其他地方遠端釋放蘑菇再用踩它。

0:29:02.160,0:29:06.540
但這有一個問題。

0:29:06.540,0:29:10.860
因為空島上的飛行帽箱沒辦法用來做手中帽bug，

0:29:10.860,0:29:16.320
克隆要空島以外的地方完成，同時HOLP要已經在星星底下。

0:29:16.320,0:29:21.300
蘑菇橋只能用一次，所以去空島兩次需要兩座蘑菇橋。

0:29:21.300,0:29:26.220
第二個策略是直接在星星下面丟出蘑菇克隆。

0:29:26.220,0:29:29.880
幸運的是，空島的這個位置離這群蘑菇夠近，讓它們可以在島上被克隆。

0:29:29.880,0:29:33.060
但是不幸的是，馬力歐沒辦法在不被蘑菇撞到的

0:29:33.060,0:29:37.500
同時把蘑菇克隆放到星星底下，讓他之後就沒辦法踩它。

0:29:37.500,0:29:43.140
在空島上沒辦法用掉落的方式避免撞到蘑菇，但是其實還有另一個方法

0:29:43.140,0:29:47.760
可以避免馬力歐撞到克隆物品。

0:29:47.760,0:29:52.080
如果馬力歐不能被蘑菇擊退，那能不能讓他先被其他東西擊退?

0:29:52.080,0:29:56.880
馬力歐被擊退的時候會強制讓他放開任何他拿著的東西，

0:29:56.880,0:30:01.140
同時避免馬力歐撞到這樣放開的蘑菇克隆，所以這個方法聽起來很棒。

0:30:01.140,0:30:05.880
但這還是有一個問題:馬力歐需要有東西穰他受傷擊退。

0:30:06.420,0:30:10.860
這邊如果你還記得我兩億年前有提到放下物品跟丟出去有一點點不同，

0:30:10.860,0:30:15.000
放下物品會把它傳送到HOLP的水平位置跟馬力歐的垂直位置。

0:30:15.000,0:30:19.200
通常HOLP會在馬力歐的手附近，這看起來就像是馬力歐把東西

0:30:19.200,0:30:29.340
放到它前面的地板上。
但如果HOLP不在馬力歐手的位置，就會有神奇的效果。

0:30:29.340,0:30:32.820
遠端放下一個物品會把它放到HOLP的水平位置跟馬力歐的垂直位置，

0:30:32.820,0:30:35.940
這個位置可能是一個新的，馬力歐根本到不了的地方。

0:30:36.480,0:30:41.160
回到那個炸彈的例子，把炸彈放下會讓它被放到那邊去。

0:30:42.000,0:30:46.980
回到【射向空島】，那個星星的位置在一個水平位置跟垂直位置很好分別到達的地方，

0:30:46.980,0:30:52.920
但要同時到達就很難了。
Pannenkoek在星星的垂直位置下方放下箱子，

0:30:52.920,0:30:57.540
使用手中帽bug，藉由在這裡把炮彈克隆放下，可以把炮彈

0:30:57.540,0:31:01.860
傳送到HOLP的水平位置，但在馬力歐的高度。

0:31:01.860,0:31:07.440
雖然馬力歐沒有去過空島，但這樣就讓砲彈克隆被傳送到空島上了。

0:31:08.220,0:31:13.020
最後馬力歐再克隆一個蘑菇，他可以藉由被砲彈擊退把這個克隆丟出，

0:31:13.020,0:31:17.460
同時不會跟這個蘑菇接觸。

0:31:17.460,0:31:21.060
然後他就可以踩在蘑菇上彈跳來收集這個星星，
這整個過程沒有用到任何一次A鍵。

0:31:22.140,0:31:25.920
你可能會覺得為什麼Pannen不直接遠端釋放一個蘑菇到島上，

0:31:25.920,0:31:30.600
而是用了一個砲彈。
因為他沒有辦法可以離克隆蘑菇的位置夠近，同時處在正確的高度位置。

0:31:30.600,0:31:35.460
唯一離這個位置夠近的蘑菇是這些蘑菇克隆，

0:31:35.460,0:31:40.920
但因為克隆不會取消載入，它們也不會載入，
所以克隆一個克隆是不可能的。

0:31:40.920,0:31:45.300
另外，我略過了要怎麼把蘑菇跟砲彈剛好載入到馬力歐

0:31:45.300,0:31:50.100
手中的空物品欄位編號。這個問題可以另外拍一部影片來解答。

0:31:50.100,0:31:54.480
其實Pannenkoek已經有一部影片講解這件事了。

0:31:54.480,0:31:59.220
簡單來說，如果有好幾個物品在同一幀取消載入，
如硬幣圈，蘑菇三人組或是其他物體群，

0:31:59.220,0:32:03.900
它們取消載入的順序會是它們載入順序的相反。
只要深入了解物品載入的行為模式跟仔細規劃動作，

0:32:03.900,0:32:07.980
就能夠控制是什麼東西載入到馬力歐的手中。

0:32:07.980,0:32:13.140
這裡Pannen用的方法其實是反覆嘗試直到他得到想要的結果。

0:32:13.140,0:32:17.820
多年以來他一直都是這麼做的，但最後經過長時間的研究，

0:32:17.820,0:32:21.600
他終於精通了克隆的技巧。
(後面待翻譯...)

0:32:25.320,0:32:30.240
這破天荒的策略是Pannenkoek在A鍵挑戰的前幾個貢獻之一。

0:32:30.240,0:32:35.700
不幸的是，雖然這個策略聽起來很扯，但是其實它沒有省下任何A鍵。

0:32:35.700,0:32:41.220
Pannenkoek不知道的是，在兩年前，一些日本TAS玩家就已經知道

0:32:41.220,0:32:45.900
可以使用龜殼跟很斜的斜坡來獲得很大的向後移動速度，然後直接飛到島上。

0:32:45.900,0:32:51.300
實際上Pannenkoek一開始的影片大多數最後的A鍵使用量都跟其他先驅的一樣。

0:32:51.300,0:32:56.700
但他還是有推動一些進展。
其中第一個是

0:32:56.700,0:33:01.860
《大小島》【Wiggler的紅幣】，受到另一位TAS玩家Plush的啟發，

0:33:01.860,0:33:07.860
用一個滑鏟彈跳到這個平台上。
這使得總A鍵使用量降到了207。

0:33:07.860,0:33:15.900
另外提一下，之前說2011年的A鍵用量是228，而在2013年是208。

0:33:15.900,0:33:20.520
就像我先前提到的，我們很難精準定量早期的A鍵用量，

0:33:20.520,0:33:25.500
所以我給了一個最保守的估計。
但是208這個數字是一個可靠的統計數字。

0:33:25.500,0:33:29.940
因為那時候已經針對全遊戲的星星做統計，

0:33:29.940,0:33:35.160
並且可以溯源到當時已知的所有策略。
228到208的主要進步來源是

0:33:35.160,0:33:40.260
《時鐘塔》的【100硬幣星星】跟【時鐘塔頂樓】合起來省了14xA,

0:33:40.260,0:33:42.660
以及其他星星的一些小進步。

0:33:42.660,0:33:47.520
在【Wiggler的紅幣】之後，Pannenkoek去看了

0:33:47.520,0:33:52.020
【彩虹毯紅幣】的舊策略。這個5xA的路線包含

0:33:52.020,0:33:56.160
用1xA搭乘這個飛毯到這個平台，

0:33:56.160,0:34:01.020
然後用剩下4xA來跑迷宮。
但是Pannen發現可以

0:34:01.020,0:34:05.880
重複利用飛毯，只需要這個A就能進迷宮。

0:34:05.880,0:34:10.260
經過精巧的路線規劃，這個新的策略只需要2xA就能拿到星星。

0:34:10.800,0:34:14.460
又過了幾個沒有進展的星星，這次pannenkoek在

0:34:14.460,0:34:18.900
《Whomp的堡壘》有了新進步。
【石板王】是一個相對簡單的星星，

0:34:18.900,0:34:23.520
要不用A到堡壘的最上面的最上面蠻簡單的，

0:34:23.520,0:34:27.900
但是打王的過程需要在石板王的背上用砸地三次，也就是需要3xA
(砸地要有一定高度，動作本身不用按A)

0:34:27.900,0:34:32.400
直到pannen想到把石板王引到升降台那邊，

0:34:32.400,0:34:37.260
用升降台來上升到他背上，這樣就可以不使用A來砸地。

0:34:37.260,0:34:41.700
不幸的是，以前只要在砸地的第三次同時就可以馬上拿到星星，

0:34:41.700,0:34:46.260
用這個策略代表需要找另一個方法不用A拿星星。

0:34:46.260,0:34:51.300
Pannen找不到，所以這個星星就先以1xA收場，省了2個A鍵。

0:34:52.020,0:34:58.260
再來他來到了《高高山》，但他很快地去《大小島》一趟來

0:34:58.260,0:35:02.880
丟這個Chuckya，然後才去《高高山》的【登山】省了兩個A鍵。

0:35:02.880,0:35:07.440
首先他用傳點複製帽子，觸發手中帽bug

0:35:07.440,0:35:13.380
複製一隻蘑菇，然後把他丟出去。
我們可以看到，蘑菇消失了，但它去了哪裡?

0:35:13.380,0:35:19.440
這個嘛，它直接出現在星星下面了!
這就是Pannen先去《大小島》一趟的原因。

0:35:19.440,0:35:24.840
HOLP只會在遊戲開始的時後被初始化一次。
在那之後，HOLP只會在

0:35:24.840,0:35:30.240
馬力歐拿著物品的時候更新，其他時候都不會變動，
包含切換關卡的時候。

0:35:30.240,0:35:35.620
馬力歐在丟《大小島》丟Chuckya的時候就把HOLP設在這個位置了。

0:35:35.620,0:35:40.620
同樣的座標在《高高山》對應到山頂，星星正下方。

0:35:40.620,0:35:45.120
所以用遠端釋放，Pannen可以在下面把蘑菇放到上面那個地方。

0:35:45.120,0:35:50.700
有一個細節我剛才略過去了。
馬力歐是怎麼不用A上去山上這個地方的?

0:35:50.700,0:35:56.040
用一種叫做「單幀行走」的新技巧。

0:35:56.040,0:36:00.660
馬力歐可以跑上一些斜坡，但有些斜坡會讓他不斷減速直到速度變成負的，

0:36:00.660,0:36:06.060
這時候他就會趴著滑下來。
但是如果馬力歐的速度夠慢，只要把搖桿從

0:36:06.060,0:36:11.520
中立位置向前推，即使在很斜的斜坡上，馬力歐也會在第一幀加速。

0:36:11.520,0:36:16.380
所以只要快速的前後移動搖桿就可以走上斜坡。

0:36:17.160,0:36:21.660
這個方法省了一個A鍵，而山頂的蘑菇克隆省了另一個A。

0:36:21.660,0:36:26.100
另外《高高山》還有其他三個星星需要經過這裡，

0:36:26.100,0:36:30.060
【猴子籠的秘密】【橋邊美景】跟

0:36:30.060,0:36:36.020
【高高山100硬幣】。
單幀行走可以三個星星各省下一個A。

0:36:36.020,0:36:40.860
這個發現使得《高高山》成為第二個0xA拿到全部星星的關卡。

0:36:42.360,0:36:47.400
不久後，Pannen研究了各種星星，主要集中在地下室的關卡,

0:36:47.400,0:36:52.200
並對一些既有策略做了小改進。
首先他在鋼鐵帽關

0:36:52.200,0:36:56.220
從一個水晶前撲受身讓馬力歐可以0xA上到按鈕上，

0:36:56.220,0:37:01.860
然後他在《沙漠》裡找到了一些聰明的策略。
他用龍捲風跟fly guy來拿到紅幣,

0:37:01.860,0:37:06.740
然後他在岩手上彈跳來拿到星星。

0:37:06.740,0:37:10.620
他還是得在這裡跳一次

0:37:10.620,0:37:15.540
才能離開升降台進入戰鬥。
再來他改進了《海盜灣》

0:37:15.540,0:37:20.820
把【海盜灣紅幣】跟【海盜灣100硬幣】一起收集，
以及只用B鍵游到

0:37:20.820,0:37:26.460
地下洞窟藍幣的位置。
然後回到《沙漠》，他複製一個箱子。

0:37:26.460,0:37:31.440
使用遠端釋放把他放在另一個箱子的邊邊，讓它在

0:37:31.440,0:37:37.260
取消載入的同時爆炸，這樣箱子就會無限噴金幣。

0:37:37.260,0:37:42.480
接著是《鬼屋》，他用一個策略在四個星星各省下1xA。

0:37:42.480,0:37:47.460
他把這些飛書引誘到他想要的地方，

0:37:47.460,0:37:52.740
然後踩在兩個飛書上，省下一個到樓頂的A鍵。

0:37:52.740,0:37:57.180
這在【陽台的大鬼】跟【秘密房間的眼球】都能省下1xA。

0:37:57.180,0:38:01.500
另外他使用大鬼來幫助他到這個箱子上，然後拿到星星，

0:38:01.500,0:38:06.720
全程不需要按A。
踩在飛書上彈跳也讓他可以不用A拿到這個紅幣，

0:38:06.720,0:38:11.160
這讓【鬼屋紅幣】省了1xA，同時也

0:38:11.160,0:38:16.260
讓不按A能拿到的硬幣數量從99到101，

0:38:16.260,0:38:20.520
代表【鬼屋100硬幣】也能0xA拿到了。

0:38:20.520,0:38:26.160
在《迷宮洞窟》可以用一個類似的方法來在【迷宮洞窟100硬幣】省下1xA。

0:38:26.160,0:38:31.140
但這裡改成是踩蝙蝠來打死snifit。

0:38:31.140,0:38:35.400
在這一堆小改進之後，Pannenkoek覺得是時候來另一場革新了。

0:38:38.940,0:38:45.740
這次不是在遊戲上，而是技術上的革新。

0:38:45.740,0:38:49.620
他從Project 64改為使用Mupen。
他終於可以告別破爛的免費試用版

0:38:49.620,0:38:56.160
螢幕錄影軟體，使用Mupen 64的AVI軟體內擷取。

0:38:56.160,0:39:01.680
但最大的改進是在軟體的TAS方便性。
Project 64只有隨時存檔功能，

0:39:01.680,0:39:05.820
所以Pannenkoek到現在為止的影片都是實時錄製的，

0:39:05.820,0:39:11.820
需要的時候暫停存檔。
Mupen 64則可以每幀播放，監控參數，跟其他一些

0:39:11.820,0:39:17.040
製作TAS時很關鍵的功能。
同時他也開始把影片跟輸入按鍵一起存下來，

0:39:17.040,0:39:21.300
這樣他就能隨時回去改進，跟他的同好分享，以及讓8年後的歷史學家

0:39:21.300,0:39:26.760
回顧並記錄這段這些歷史。
於是繼日本TAS玩家之後，

0:39:26.760,0:39:31.620
清晰的30FPS A鍵挑戰影片第二次出現了。

0:39:31.620,0:39:35.940
有了這個高品質的配置，他感覺可以來挑戰遊戲中

0:39:35.940,0:39:42.300
最聞風喪膽的關卡了，《時鐘塔》。
首先他把【搭乘指針】降到0xA，

0:39:42.300,0:39:47.780
他找到了用爬上這堆旋轉平台的方法，
用砸地撞上牆讓馬力歐暈眩。

0:39:47.780,0:39:52.620
在撞牆動畫播放的時候馬力歐不會從旋轉平台上滑下來,

0:39:52.620,0:39:56.980
動畫時間足夠讓平台轉夠多使馬力歐可以站在上面。

0:39:56.980,0:40:02.100
Alkhdaniel使用一個類似的策略，先用1xA

0:40:02.100,0:40:06.360
來獲得一點高度，但是Pannen的新方法可以完全不用A鍵上去。

0:40:06.360,0:40:12.240
這個新策略不只在【搭乘指針】省A鍵，同時也

0:40:12.240,0:40:17.760
是對關卡裡每個星星的改進。
這讓【時鐘塔紅幣】從1xA變成0xA。

0:40:17.760,0:40:24.840
他把【跳進籠子】從7xA減到4xA，
【移動平台】從11xA減到7xA，

0:40:24.840,0:40:30.900
以上配合精準的Heave-ho上拋來達成。
用以上所有策略搭配更精準的平台移動把

0:40:30.900,0:40:35.960
【時鐘塔100硬幣星星】加上【時鐘塔頂樓】從15xA減到9xA。

0:40:35.960,0:40:41.460
最後，【洞與鐘擺】也從6xA減到了4xA，

0:40:41.460,0:40:46.200
搭配紅幣旋轉平台與更好的跳躍方式來節省另一個A。

0:40:46.860,0:40:52.320
在他拆除《時鐘塔》的同時，Pannen也順便在研究《天上的庫巴》。

0:40:52.320,0:40:57.780
原本13x的紀錄已經相當不錯了，但Pannen發現有三個地方可以改進。

0:40:57.780,0:41:01.920
首先，這裡精準的滑鏟可以讓馬力歐

0:41:01.920,0:41:06.900
繞過障礙物。再來另一個精準的前撲受身

0:41:06.900,0:41:11.520
讓他可以越過這些平台，最後他引誘蘑菇

0:41:11.520,0:41:15.660
讓它下來被踩來省下第三個A鍵,總共剩10xA。

0:41:16.260,0:41:21.960
Pannenkoek的下一站是《可怕的港口》，
這裡他的第一個改進就是一個大的:

0:41:21.960,0:41:26.340
這裡他把【可怕的港口紅幣】，A鍵挑戰的惡夢

0:41:26.340,0:41:33.600
從10xA減到了3.5xA。
等等，這到底是什麼意思?

0:41:33.600,0:41:37.560
這裡可以簡單的解釋一下。
請讓我介紹0.5A鍵的意思。

0:41:43.020,0:41:47.760
有水的關卡對A鍵挑戰來說帶來了一個特別的問題，
因為要游泳需要一直不斷按A。

0:41:47.760,0:41:52.520
如果不按A，馬力歐的水下移動方式就非常受限。

0:41:52.520,0:41:57.540
他只能慢慢下沉，或是在接近表面的時候慢慢上浮。

0:41:57.540,0:42:02.280
他可以按B抓東西，這讓他可以稍微向前移動。

0:42:02.280,0:42:06.240
或是如果他抓到一個龜殼

0:42:06.240,0:42:11.040
他就能一段時間內稍微動的快一些。
但是有時馬力歐可以拿著物品游泳，

0:42:11.040,0:42:16.020
等等就會需要這個情況。
這樣B鍵就不能用來游泳，

0:42:16.020,0:42:20.160
因為馬力歐會把東西丟掉而不是游泳。
有一個解決辦法:

0:42:20.160,0:42:24.660
如果按著A，馬力歐就會像這樣游泳，拿著東西的時候也一樣。

0:42:24.660,0:42:30.180
但這需要A鍵被按住，所以這需要1xA，對嗎?

0:42:31.020,0:42:36.360
假設只看當下情況，對，這需要1xA。
但假設現在是從全遊戲的角度來看，

0:42:36.360,0:42:41.740
你可以在其他需要按A的星星按A，然後就按著不放。

0:42:41.740,0:42:46.500
這樣這兩個A鍵就會合併成一個很長的A鍵，

0:42:46.500,0:42:52.760
達成許多不同的功能。
所以他為什麼叫做3.5xA呢?

0:42:52.760,0:42:58.020
這個點五的表記法代表一個狀況的兩面性。

0:42:58.020,0:43:03.120
假如只看這個星星，我們就把A鍵使用量進位成4xA，

0:43:03.120,0:43:07.620
假如是把整個遊戲的星星串聯就捨去成3xA。

0:43:07.620,0:43:13.740
因為它可以使用前一個星星的A鍵。
3.5xA在全遊戲比4xA鍵好，

0:43:13.740,0:43:18.360
但在單顆星星比3xA爛，所以放.5在中間感覺蠻有道理的。

0:43:19.020,0:43:23.460
現在解釋清楚.5的部分了，那麼Pannen是怎麼把這個星星改進這麼多的呢?

0:43:24.300,0:43:28.920
首先他先從底部抓一個龜殼，然後把它帶到水面。

0:43:28.920,0:43:32.460
如果馬力歐拿著龜殼游泳的時候龜殼的使用時間到了，或是他上岸，

0:43:32.460,0:43:38.040
龜殼就會消失。
這段時間沒有很長，讓龜殼在正常遊戲中沒什麼用。

0:43:38.040,0:43:43.080
但是這邊是有趣的地方:龜殼只會在馬力歐帶著他游泳時消失，

0:43:43.080,0:43:48.580
但瑪力歐還是可以把它丟掉。
馬力歐把龜殼丟掉的幾個幀內時候，他其實還是拿著它，

0:43:48.580,0:43:53.700
但他不算拿著龜殼游泳。所以只要把龜殼丟掉的同時上浮把動作中斷，

0:43:53.700,0:43:59.340
馬力歐就不會把龜殼摧毀，然後就可以拿著他直到永遠。

0:43:59.340,0:44:05.600
現在他就可以帶龜殼到任何地方。
然而，這個龜殼現在的功能消失，變成一個普通的物品了。

0:44:05.600,0:44:11.460
為了帶著這個龜殼去其他地方，馬力歐需要按著A來游泳。

0:44:11.460,0:44:16.500
這裡就是為什麼需要額外的0.5xA。
所以他到底要帶著龜殼去哪裡?

0:44:16.500,0:44:18.340
《可怕的港口》被中間的隧道分成兩個大房間。

0:44:18.340,0:44:23.080
隧道中間有一個載入點，馬力歐跨過的時候會切換房間。

0:44:23.080,0:44:27.780
這個切換的動作包含取消載入第一個房間所有物品然後載入第二個房間，

0:44:27.780,0:44:32.640
來省遊戲記憶體。
所以這邊馬力歐如果跨過載入點時拿著

0:44:32.640,0:44:37.020
會被取消載入的物品，像是龜殼，能做什麼?
當然是克隆!

0:44:37.020,0:44:42.180
取消載入龜殼之後，馬力歐拿著空物品欄位，現在可以載入

0:44:42.180,0:44:46.320
一些奇怪的物品。一樣經過一些計畫，

0:44:46.320,0:44:50.460
Pannenkoek把一根爬竿載入到馬力歐手中，

0:44:50.460,0:44:54.640
這樣他就可以拿著他並丟到某個地方。

0:44:54.640,0:44:59.340
因為這邊爬竿沒有載入器，所以這是一個克隆不會複製東西的例子。

0:44:59.340,0:45:04.200
只是把爬竿帶去別的地方。
所以Pannen要注意他帶走的是哪根爬竿，

0:45:04.200,0:45:08.520
確定他不是拿到之後需要爬的那根。

0:45:08.520,0:45:12.940
把爬竿放掉之後，他就可以用1xA爬到上面的平台。

0:45:12.940,0:45:17.640
從這裡開始就是要不按A繞過爬竿，

0:45:17.640,0:45:20.940
搭配一些簡單的前撲跟抓取。

0:45:20.940,0:45:24.780
另一個A是用來到最遠的那根爬竿，

0:45:24.780,0:45:30.060
拿到紅幣後在掉回水中。
還有一個A跟第二個爬竿克隆用來拿到最後一個紅幣。

0:45:30.060,0:45:35.460
helped by the fact that these poles are actually 
longer than their visual model suggests. All that

0:45:35.460,0:45:40.260
was left was the star, which unfortunately 
wasn’t easy to reach either. But thankfully,

0:45:40.260,0:45:46.140
just like any other object, stars can also be 
cloned! Remember that releasing an object clone

0:45:46.140,0:45:51.900
physically moves that object to the new location. 
Clones aren’t just broken copies of an object,

0:45:51.900,0:45:57.780
they are the actual object. They only become 
a copy if a spawner spawns the original object

0:45:57.780,0:46:03.600
again. So, the star that Mario is collecting is 
absolutely real. He’s able to collect it remotely

0:46:03.600,0:46:08.280
without any additional A presses, for a total 
of 3, plus having to hold A at the beginning.

0:46:09.120,0:46:12.960
For the rest of Dire, Dire Docks, the 
half A press shell swimming strategy

0:46:12.960,0:46:16.980
to clone a star was relevant for most 
stars, aside from Manta Ray’s Reward,

0:46:16.980,0:46:21.420
which didn’t require any A presses, and the 
100-coin star, which, for now, Pannen left

0:46:21.420,0:46:26.640
alone. Also, Chests in the Current did require 
A swimming as well, not because of cloning,

0:46:26.640,0:46:30.900
but because of the whirlpool forcing Mario to 
swim at least a little bit more efficiently.

0:46:31.440,0:46:36.540
This brought down the total A press count by 
4, because 4 stars that were previously listed

0:46:36.540,0:46:41.760
as needing one A press could now be completed 
simply by leeching off a previous A press instead.

0:46:41.760,0:46:47.880
But the half A press was not going to be limited 
only to Dire, Dire Docks. It proved useful in

0:46:47.880,0:46:53.700
Wing Mario over the Rainbow as well. Holding A has 
more benefits, like falling slower while twirling,

0:46:53.700,0:46:57.540
which, remember, was already known 
over a decade earlier. But also,

0:46:57.540,0:47:02.280
holding A allows Mario to fall slower with the 
wing cap, and to kick by tapping the B button.

0:47:02.280,0:47:07.680
Kicking can help Mario get up steep slopes, 
although frame-walking obsoletes that one. Here,

0:47:07.680,0:47:12.480
however, falling slower with the wing cap allows 
Mario to reach the bottom platform to shoot out

0:47:12.480,0:47:18.600
from the cannon. Because this star still requires 
two cannon shots, the A press count was now 2.5.

0:47:19.560,0:47:24.300
At this point, aside from a few stray stars, 
the only levels left for Pannenkoek to explore

0:47:24.300,0:47:29.940
were Snowman’s Land and Wet-Dry World. Snowman’s 
Land was already nearly figured out before Pannen

0:47:29.940,0:47:34.980
even touched it, but Wet-Dry world totalled 18 
A presses, nearly half of which were for the red

0:47:34.980,0:47:40.980
coins star alone. So, there was a lot of potential 
for improvement. Pannen started with Secrets in

0:47:40.980,0:47:45.780
the Shallows & Sky. Note that because entering 
levels is also an implicit part of the challenge,

0:47:45.780,0:47:51.060
you can’t just enter Wet-Dry World any way you 
want. The initial water level depends on the

0:47:51.060,0:47:55.500
height at which Mario enters the painting, so with 
no jumps, the only available initial water level

0:47:55.500,0:48:00.480
is the lowest one. Thankfully, there is a warp 
to the cannon platform at the top of the stage,

0:48:00.480,0:48:03.540
and there are Heave-hos that can 
flip Mario up to higher levels.

0:48:03.540,0:48:08.340
Pannen used a combination of those to get 
most of the secrets, but the last one was

0:48:08.340,0:48:12.660
a bit trickier. The previous strategy 
was to use a cannon shot to reach it,

0:48:12.660,0:48:17.040
but instead, he got a helping hand from 
Chuckya. He manipulated the random number

0:48:17.040,0:48:21.780
generated by the game, or RNG value, to be 
favourable so that Chuckya would throw Mario

0:48:21.780,0:48:26.640
directly onto the wooden bridge, which let 
him access the final secret in 0 A presses.

0:48:27.180,0:48:31.620
He used the same strategy to save an A 
press in Express Elevator - Hurry Up!,

0:48:31.620,0:48:36.420
and the 100-coin star. Top o’ the Town was 
still problematic because despite being able

0:48:36.420,0:48:41.400
to get all the way to breaking the box in 0 A 
presses, he had to jump to get the star. The

0:48:41.400,0:48:46.680
old strategy from 2008 was to use a cannon shot to 
go directly on top of the box and ground pound it,

0:48:46.680,0:48:50.460
which also took one A press. But since 
activating the cannon took an additional

0:48:50.460,0:48:54.240
A press that was not counted at the time, 
this new method was an indirect improvement.

0:48:54.240,0:49:00.480
But the real problematic stars were Quick Race 
through Downtown, and the red coin star. Those

0:49:00.480,0:49:05.400
were sitting at 5 and 8 A presses respectively 
before Pannenkoek had a crack at them.

0:49:05.940,0:49:08.760
The solution he found for each 
of them is pretty complex,

0:49:08.760,0:49:10.860
so let’s start with Quick Race through Downtown.

0:49:10.860,0:49:16.740
When Mario throws Chuckya, it will explode into 
5 coins upon landing. This explosion happens

0:49:16.740,0:49:22.260
based on Chuckya’s state of being thrown. Here, 
Mario throws Chuckya and falls off the ledge at

0:49:22.260,0:49:27.300
the same time, which lets him catch up to it and 
intercept it while it’s falling down. Chuckya then

0:49:27.300,0:49:32.520
grabs Mario in mid-air, which changes its state 
from being thrown to holding Mario. Therefore,

0:49:32.520,0:49:36.240
when it lands on the ground, it no longer 
wants to explode, which effectively brings

0:49:36.240,0:49:42.060
Chuckya down to this level. From there, Pannen 
abuses object collision priority and uses Chuckya

0:49:42.060,0:49:46.500
to push Mario inside of the block and throw 
Chuckya through the wall. Immediately after,

0:49:46.500,0:49:50.460
he gets caught by Chuckya again, and both 
of them fall down into the pipe below,

0:49:50.460,0:49:54.360
where Mario can retrieve Chuckya and 
carry it around in the water. There are

0:49:54.360,0:49:58.920
other ways to bring Chuckya here, but this 
clever method uses no A presses to do so.

0:49:58.920,0:50:04.980
Once Mario is holding Chuckya underwater, he needs 
to swim. He could do that simply by holding A,

0:50:04.980,0:50:08.640
but unfortunately, that doesn’t work 
after pressing B to grab an object,

0:50:08.640,0:50:13.140
so he actually needs to press the A button 
once. But from there, he has a hold of an

0:50:13.140,0:50:16.980
object and the tunnel contains a loading zone 
that switches between the main area and the

0:50:16.980,0:50:21.660
downtown part of Wet-Dry World, and so he can 
clone the Quick Race through Downtown star. Note

0:50:21.660,0:50:25.860
that the cloning of a star can only be done if 
the star is already out there and collectable,

0:50:25.860,0:50:28.620
so the same can’t be done for 
something like the red coins,

0:50:28.620,0:50:34.140
for instance. But just like that, he managed to 
get that star from 5 down to only one A press.

0:50:34.140,0:50:39.240
The Red coin star was definitely the most 
challenging because it posed multiple problems

0:50:39.240,0:50:44.520
at once. To access most red coins, Mario needs 
to break a box, which he can only do out of the

0:50:44.520,0:50:49.260
water. However, if the water level is low, then 
he needs a lot of A presses to reach the higher

0:50:49.260,0:50:54.420
platforms. So, he both needs the water level to 
be high so that he can navigate without using A,

0:50:54.420,0:50:59.460
but also to be low, so that he can break the 
boxes the coins are in. If he lowers the water

0:50:59.460,0:51:03.600
to break a box, he needs a way to raise it back 
up, and the only crystal that raises the water

0:51:03.600,0:51:08.880
is way up there, inaccessible on low water 
without jumping a bunch of times. This web of

0:51:08.880,0:51:15.120
restrictions is nearly impossible to navigate. But 
if it’s nearly impossible, it’s not impossible.

0:51:15.120,0:51:19.920
But there was a price to pay. In his 
own words, that star was a total pain

0:51:19.920,0:51:24.900
to record and edit. And you know what? I 
believe him: the strategy takes 14 hours

0:51:24.900,0:51:31.500
to execute. Breaking down how all of it works 
would be too gigantic of a task. So let’s do it.

0:51:33.780,0:51:35.696
The water in Wet-Dry World can be raised or 
lowered using these crystals, but it’s not

0:51:35.696,0:51:40.080
the only way in which it moves. If you pay close 
attention, you can see that even when it’s at a

0:51:40.080,0:51:45.180
fixed height, the water level bobs up and down by 
a significant amount. This is not purely visual:

0:51:45.180,0:51:50.220
the actual water level follows a sinusoidal 
function with an amplitude of 20 units and a

0:51:50.220,0:51:55.260
period of 128 frames. In other words, 
the water has a median level and it

0:51:55.260,0:52:00.240
deviates from that median by up 20 units on 
a cycle that repeats every 4 seconds or so.

0:52:00.780,0:52:06.000
The downtown area’s water level is independent 
from the main area. When Mario goes from downtown

0:52:06.000,0:52:11.100
to the main area, the water level is preserved 
for when he comes back. But here’s the key thing:

0:52:11.100,0:52:16.320
the current water level is saved, and then used 
as the median water level when Mario comes back.

0:52:16.320,0:52:21.120
Therefore, if Mario loads the downtown area, and 
unloads it when the water is above the median,

0:52:21.120,0:52:24.180
when he comes back, the new median 
will be here, and the water level

0:52:24.180,0:52:28.680
will rise and dip 20 units around that 
new line. If you repeat this process,

0:52:28.680,0:52:33.720
you can raise the water level arbitrarily 
high, 20 units at a time. If you do the

0:52:33.720,0:52:37.140
opposite and leave when it’s below the 
median, you can lower it the same way.

0:52:37.140,0:52:42.540
However, this is easier said than done. The 
loading zone is in the middle of an underwater

0:52:42.540,0:52:46.860
tunnel, which means Mario cannot simply stay 
here and swim in circles around the loading

0:52:46.860,0:52:52.200
zone to raise or lower the water as he pleases. 
He needs to get some air from time to time. So,

0:52:52.200,0:52:56.580
the water in the main area needs to be at 
its lowest level. To access this corner,

0:52:56.580,0:53:01.320
you can simply slide along this ledge, carefully 
keeping Mario on with a precise angle and stick

0:53:01.320,0:53:06.720
movement. And now, Mario has just barely enough 
time to lower the water level once before he has

0:53:06.720,0:53:12.420
to rush back and get some air. So, this process is 
extremely tedious. To get this part done without

0:53:12.420,0:53:17.220
actually repeating all of this work over and over 
for days, Pannenkoek figured out a way to make

0:53:17.220,0:53:22.440
a sequence of inputs that would be loopable, and 
repeated it for however many iterations he needed.

0:53:22.440,0:53:27.960
After lowering the water 26 times, he could 
finally enter downtown. By now, the water

0:53:27.960,0:53:32.220
was low enough that he could get some air inside 
the tunnel itself, and he could go and break this

0:53:32.220,0:53:37.260
first box. But as you can see, this grate prevents 
him from lowering the water any more than that,

0:53:37.260,0:53:42.300
because it would block access to downtown if he 
did. So, Pannen has to raise the water instead.

0:53:42.300,0:53:49.500
He does so for 4 hours. In that time, 
the water level is raised 398 times. Now,

0:53:49.500,0:53:54.240
the water level is far above the top of 
the stage. At this point, it’s so high up,

0:53:54.240,0:53:58.320
that when Mario touches the low crystal, he 
has time to swim up to a higher platform before

0:53:58.320,0:54:03.420
the water level catches up. Or at least, he 
would, if he had enough air. Unfortunately,

0:54:03.420,0:54:08.100
B swimming is so slow that Mario would 
drown before he got there. But thankfully,

0:54:08.100,0:54:12.480
coins restore energy. By grabbing 
a few coins along the way, Pannen

0:54:12.480,0:54:16.920
was able to extend his underwater time just 
enough to make this genius route possible.

0:54:16.920,0:54:22.380
After this high anxiety swim up to the 
top, Mario is now high up in 0 A presses,

0:54:22.380,0:54:27.300
while the water is low, which lets him break 
boxes, and he has access to the high crystal, so

0:54:27.300,0:54:32.400
he can raise the water back up and go back to the 
main area if needed. He activates the high crystal

0:54:32.400,0:54:37.440
and dives down to one of the boxes to break it 
just before the water catches up. From there,

0:54:37.440,0:54:42.180
he only needs to get some air and he can go back 
and repeat this process again to break more boxes.

0:54:42.180,0:54:49.500
And that’s what he does. For another 4 hours, 
he raises the water 366 times and repeats the

0:54:49.500,0:54:54.780
same process. However, coins are limited, so he 
has to become more and more creative with how

0:54:54.780,0:55:00.360
he uses them to buy himself more underwater time. 
The longer he has to go out of his way to get more

0:55:00.360,0:55:05.820
coins, the more coins he needs to get to offset 
that extra time. This time, he has just barely

0:55:05.820,0:55:11.580
enough time to break this second box. Then, he 
goes back and raises the water another 376 times,

0:55:11.580,0:55:15.780
uses up the last few yellow coins he has 
to his disposal, and breaks one more box.

0:55:16.500,0:55:22.800
In one final trip, he raises the water 154 times, 
and then, with almost no coins left to keep him

0:55:22.800,0:55:27.420
alive, collects all the red coins that he left 
behind specifically for this moment, and he

0:55:27.420,0:55:34.440
breaks off the last few boxes and gets the star. 
All of that in 0 A presses, and only 14 hours.

0:55:35.160,0:55:40.860
Even among all the cloning he had done, this 
single star was probably the most intense strategy

0:55:40.860,0:55:46.620
Pannenkoek had pulled off up to this point. 
It also saved an astonishing 8 A presses in

0:55:46.620,0:55:51.180
a single go, making it to this day the largest 
single improvement in the challenge’s history.

0:55:51.960,0:55:53.580
And he wasn’t even done yet.

0:55:54.300,0:55:59.340
But he was almost done. He took a look at the 
red coin stars in the first two Bowser stages

0:55:59.340,0:56:04.080
and found some improvements in them. In Bowser 
in the Dark World, he lured a Goomba down here

0:56:04.080,0:56:08.940
so he could bounce on it, and used framewalking 
to tilt a bridge 90º and go up to a red coin,

0:56:08.940,0:56:13.860
saving three A presses in total to bring 
it down to 2. In Bowser in the Fire Sea,

0:56:13.860,0:56:16.020
he was able to use a Bob-omb to clone the star,

0:56:16.020,0:56:19.740
saving the two A presses normally 
required to get up to it and grab it.

0:56:19.740,0:56:24.780
In the final level he still had to go through, 
Snowman’s Land, only two A presses remained,

0:56:24.780,0:56:29.700
and he was able to save one of them. He got 
In the Deep Freeze from 1 to 0 A presses,

0:56:29.700,0:56:33.660
using Koopa shell hyperspeed. This 
had already been used before by the

0:56:33.660,0:56:37.620
Japanese TASers, but I glossed over 
it until now. Here’s how it works.

0:56:37.620,0:56:42.720
The way speed on slopes is handled is fairly 
simple. When Mario is moving on a slope,

0:56:42.720,0:56:46.920
his speed is calculated in such a way that 
he moves the same distance along that slope

0:56:46.920,0:56:51.360
than if he were on flat ground. So, with 
a speed of 30 on flat ground, Mario will

0:56:51.360,0:56:57.000
move 30 units forward. But on a 30º slope, 
Mario will move by 30 units along the slope,

0:56:57.000,0:57:02.220
which translates to 15 units up and 26 units 
forward. The way the game does this is that

0:57:02.220,0:57:06.780
it factors Mario’s speed by the cosine of the 
slope he’s on to determine his lateral movement,

0:57:06.780,0:57:11.040
and then moves him up or down to match the 
new height of the floor. This effective speed,

0:57:11.040,0:57:15.300
which is always equal to or lower than Mario’s 
real speed, is called the de facto speed.

0:57:15.960,0:57:20.040
Now, this method works flawlessly when Mario 
is running parallel to the direction of the

0:57:20.040,0:57:24.420
slope. But if he’s moving perpendicularly 
to it, this speed reduction no longer makes

0:57:24.420,0:57:28.980
sense. Nonetheless, it is still applied, no 
matter which direction Mario is moving in.

0:57:28.980,0:57:33.360
This is why he appears to slow down when 
going from flat ground to sloped ground,

0:57:33.360,0:57:38.387
despite keeping a similar speed. And this is the 
mechanic that makes shell hyperspeed possible.

0:57:38.387,0:57:39.960
Mario rides the shell up a very steep slope 
and angles himself sideways. When Mario tries

0:57:39.960,0:57:44.880
to ride up a steep slope, he’ll rapidly lose 
speed and even slide back down the slope. But

0:57:44.880,0:57:49.800
if he’s angled right, something interesting can 
happen. The backwards acceleration is the same,

0:57:49.800,0:57:55.140
so long as Mario is facing up the slope, even 
if he barely is. Because the slope is so steep,

0:57:55.140,0:57:59.280
his de facto speed is a tiny fraction of his 
real speed, so he basically stays in place,

0:57:59.280,0:58:04.440
despite his increasingly high speed. So, by 
facing ever so slightly up very steep slopes,

0:58:04.440,0:58:09.660
he can accumulate over 200 negative speed, 
about 7 times more than regular walking speed.

0:58:09.660,0:58:14.940
All he needs to do next is to redirect that speed 
to propel himself to the star in 0 A presses.

0:58:16.200,0:58:21.780
There were only a few stars left. Rainbow 
Ride 100 coins was moderately easy with

0:58:21.780,0:58:25.500
the techniques Pannen had developed. 
After one A press to reach the cruiser,

0:58:25.500,0:58:29.880
he was able to get a hold of an exploding 
bob-omb and clone 51 coins to reach 100

0:58:29.880,0:58:33.900
without having to go around the whole 
course. By the way, a quick detail:

0:58:33.900,0:58:38.220
while there are other bob-ombs in Rainbow Ride, 
only the one on the cruiser is close enough to

0:58:38.220,0:58:42.523
coins to clone them. The ones at the bottom 
of the maze are too far away from any coins.

0:58:42.523,0:58:48.000
Dire, Dire Docks 100 coins was a little 
more complicated. Using the shell method

0:58:48.000,0:58:51.960
that he used to clone poles and a star, 
he could clone coins, but there is a more

0:58:51.960,0:58:57.420
efficient method. Instead of cloning coins one 
by one, he could clone an entire ring of coins!

0:58:57.420,0:59:01.440
Like we’ve seen before, rings of 
coins are handled by an intangible,

0:59:01.440,0:59:06.780
invisible object called a spawner. On top of 
deciding when to load or unload a group of coins,

0:59:06.780,0:59:09.420
it also keeps track of which of 
its coins have been collected,

0:59:09.420,0:59:13.440
so it can stay consistent when you load 
the coins in and out of memory. However,

0:59:13.440,0:59:19.020
just like every other object, coin ring spawners 
can be cloned. Here’s how the process works.

0:59:19.020,0:59:24.540
The cloning part works exactly the same. But 
to clone an object, you need to be holding a

0:59:24.540,0:59:29.160
vacant slot for it to load into. The problem with 
spawners is that they are loaded when you enter

0:59:29.160,0:59:34.260
the level, and they always stay loaded no matter 
how far Mario is from them. There is, however,

0:59:34.260,0:59:39.960
one exception. If a level has multiple segments 
separated by a loading zone, such as Wet-Dry World

0:59:39.960,0:59:45.480
or Dire, Dire Docks, then it is possible to load 
and unload a spawner. When a spawner is cloned,

0:59:45.480,0:59:50.640
it will simply look like an invisible object. 
Just like any other object not meant to be thrown,

0:59:50.640,0:59:55.560
once the clone is released, it will cease to 
function properly. So, it will also stop handling

0:59:55.560,1:00:00.540
the loading and unloading of the coin ring. If 
a coin spawner clone is released, its associated

1:00:00.540,1:00:05.340
coin ring will no longer load when Mario goes 
near it. But if the spawner clone is released

1:00:05.340,1:00:09.840
while the coins are already loaded, then they 
will no longer unload when Mario goes far away.

1:00:09.840,1:00:13.980
Also, when a coin from a coin ring is 
cloned, because its behaviour is broken,

1:00:13.980,1:00:18.060
it will be unable to send a signal to its 
spawner to indicate that it’s been collected,

1:00:18.060,1:00:23.040
so the spawner will spawn it again when Mario 
goes near, thus duplicating the coin. This

1:00:23.040,1:00:27.900
works exactly the same way if the spawner is 
the one being cloned. The coins in the ring

1:00:27.900,1:00:31.560
can be collected, and they will send a signal 
to the spawner that they no longer should be

1:00:31.560,1:00:36.720
loaded the next time the ring is loaded, but the 
spawner will be unable to receive the message. So,

1:00:36.720,1:00:40.740
when Mario reloads the area through the 
loading zone, the reloaded spawner will have

1:00:40.740,1:00:44.040
no memory of the coins being collected, 
and it will spawn them all over again.

1:00:44.040,1:00:48.960
This method can be used specifically in Dire, 
Dire Docks to duplicate whole rings of coins

1:00:48.960,1:00:54.000
at once instead of one at a time, significantly 
speeding up the process. This is what Pannen did:

1:00:54.000,1:01:00.480
he got 56 extra coins from 7 coin ring spawner 
clones and got the 100-coin star in 0.5 A presses.

1:01:00.480,1:01:05.880
In Tiny-Huge Island, Pannen got Make 
Wiggler Squirm from 1 down to 0 A presses,

1:01:05.880,1:01:08.880
by riding a shell up the mountain 
and clipping in using Chuckya.

1:01:08.880,1:01:14.040
Around this time, he also found an improvement 
in Wet-Dry World, in Express Elevator - Hurry

1:01:14.040,1:01:18.840
up! He found that by raising the water level, 
he was able to hold A and swim onto the elevator

1:01:18.840,1:01:23.400
instead of jumping to it. The timing for it 
is very tight, but it is indeed possible.

1:01:23.400,1:01:29.340
This reduced the A press count from 1 to 0.5, 
because he needed A to be held and not pressed.

1:01:30.300,1:01:35.580
At this point, Pannenkoek was nearing the end of 
his journey through every star in the game. He

1:01:35.580,1:01:40.200
realized that he also needed to account for all 
the A presses necessary to navigate the castle

1:01:40.200,1:01:45.900
between all the levels. So, he dedicated a video 
to all of them. Most of it is pretty trivial,

1:01:45.900,1:01:50.280
and like I discussed before, the total 
comes up to 23 if you’re being efficient.

1:01:50.280,1:01:54.840
He found one precise sideflip to grab 
the ledge to Rainbow Ride on one side,

1:01:54.840,1:01:59.880
and Wing Mario over the Rainbow on the other, 
which brought the total down to 21. He proved

1:01:59.880,1:02:04.620
that the 5 stars available inside the castle 
itself were all obtainable in 0 A presses.

1:02:04.620,1:02:09.900
And he completed his meticulous run through the 
complete A Button Challenge in Whomp’s Fortress,

1:02:09.900,1:02:14.820
by doing Fall Onto the Caged Island the same way 
the Japanese TASers did it a few years prior.

1:02:15.960,1:02:20.580
Finally, after all this work, Pannenkoek, 
with some help from Plush, managed to cut

1:02:20.580,1:02:27.780
the 120-star A press count nearly in half, 
from 208 to 116. But we lost track of time

1:02:27.780,1:02:34.020
during this epic journey. How many years have 
passed? 3 years, 4 years? Maybe even 5 years?

1:02:34.020,1:02:39.120
How about two months. That’s 
right. This entire revolution

1:02:39.120,1:02:42.840
of the Super Mario 64 A Button 
Challenge took two months from

1:02:42.840,1:02:47.460
beginning to end. And the best part? 
Pannenkoek was only getting started.

1:02:47.460,1:02:54.300
From August 25th to October 26th, 2013, 
Pannenkoek2012 completely reinvented the A

1:02:54.300,1:03:00.300
Button Challenge, almost entirely by himself. His 
unprecedented dedication and endless creativity,

1:03:00.300,1:03:03.840
further enabled by a deep knowledge 
of the game and its infinite quirks,

1:03:03.840,1:03:07.620
allowed him to come up with ideas and 
strategies far more advanced than anything

1:03:07.620,1:03:12.840
that had been done before. Such stellar work 
was bound to be noticed. And sure enough,

1:03:12.840,1:03:18.480
it was noticed. By pretty much the entire 
speedrunning community at the time. Some people

1:03:18.480,1:03:23.580
were interested in more than just watching. From 
this point on, Pannenkoek was no longer alone.

1:03:29.220,1:03:32.460
As soon as he completed his pass 
through every star in the game,

1:03:32.460,1:03:36.960
Pannen moved on to other challenges, such as 
no buttons allowed, and no joystick allowed,

1:03:36.960,1:03:42.120
where the only easy movement option is punching 
and jumping to slowly inch forward. The A Button

1:03:42.120,1:03:46.080
Challenge project cooled down a bit, since there 
was little incentive to go back to it unless

1:03:46.080,1:03:50.880
something new had been discovered. He didn’t 
revisit the challenge until late March 2014,

1:03:50.880,1:03:54.960
when he found that enemy luring strategies, 
which had been used to some extent before,

1:03:54.960,1:03:57.600
had more potential than he 
had given them credit for.

1:03:57.600,1:04:02.460
In Hazy Maze Cave, swoopers fly on a 
perfectly horizontal plane after their

1:04:02.460,1:04:07.320
initial takeoff. He used that to his advantage 
by luring a swooper all the way to this slope,

1:04:07.320,1:04:11.940
which raised it enough that he could bounce on it 
and reach this ledge to A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit,

1:04:11.940,1:04:17.220
cutting one A press in the process. The same could 
be done for Navigating the Toxic Maze, which is

1:04:17.220,1:04:22.200
just the other alcove to the right, but that one 
was a bit more involved. Because there’s no mole

1:04:22.200,1:04:26.880
here, he instead had to align three swoopers at 
three increasing heights, all set up by luring

1:04:26.880,1:04:31.560
them to various slopes, so he could reach the 
higher ledge. This posed a very interesting

1:04:31.560,1:04:37.020
logistical issue. Pannenkoek used his buddy, pen 
and paper, to solve and illustrate the puzzle.

1:04:37.620,1:04:42.840
Enemy luring could also be applied with boos. 
While he did use a bookend bounce to reach

1:04:42.840,1:04:47.640
this red coin before, the other red coin in this 
room still required an A press. But with clever

1:04:47.640,1:04:52.980
manipulation, Pannen got Boos to line up under it 
and bounced on them to reach the coin. However,

1:04:52.980,1:04:57.360
because he needed kicks to get a bit of starting 
height, which require A to be held, he was only

1:04:57.360,1:05:03.120
able to get Big Boo’s Haunt red coins from 2 down 
to 1.5 A presses. But remember, because full game

1:05:03.120,1:05:08.760
runs round down half A presses, this was still 
good to lower the total A press count to 113.

1:05:08.760,1:05:13.920
In the meantime, Pannenkoek also made a brand 
new glitch discovery: Transport cloning.

1:05:16.320,1:05:19.860
Objects that can move around, 
like goombas and bob-ombs,

1:05:19.860,1:05:22.860
have collision detection amongst 
themselves. We’ve already seen

1:05:22.860,1:05:26.760
how this can lead to strange behaviour 
while holding a bob-omb. The function

1:05:26.760,1:05:30.900
that handles the result of these collisions 
is the key to understand transport cloning.

1:05:31.560,1:05:36.780
Two goombas run into each other. Their respective 
positions cause their hitboxes to overlap,

1:05:36.780,1:05:42.360
so the game attempts to reposition them. First, 
it finds the relative distance between them. Then,

1:05:42.360,1:05:46.680
it finds the midpoint on this line, and 
finally, it moves each goomba along the

1:05:46.680,1:05:50.700
line from that point by their radius, 
so their hitboxes end up tangential to

1:05:50.700,1:05:55.440
each other. In the more generic case of two 
objects with different radii, the line is

1:05:55.440,1:06:00.600
divided with the same ratio as the radii of the 
objects. When the two objects are repositioned,

1:06:00.600,1:06:05.340
their hitboxes will always be tangential 
at that point along the line. While such

1:06:05.340,1:06:09.900
a scenario is technically possible, by far 
the most common case involves two goombas,

1:06:09.900,1:06:13.560
so they are placed at the exact halfway 
point between their original positions.

1:06:13.560,1:06:18.240
The transport cloning glitch happens when a 
goomba clone is released while the original

1:06:18.240,1:06:23.700
is currently colliding with another goomba. The 
key reason why it happens is that the goomba is

1:06:23.700,1:06:27.240
warped to the HOLP after the collision 
is detected, but before the collision

1:06:27.240,1:06:31.920
handling function is run. When the function 
finds the relative distance between them,

1:06:31.920,1:06:37.140
what should be a small distance ends up being 
arbitrarily large. After that, the game finds

1:06:37.140,1:06:41.580
the midpoint and places each goomba one radius 
away in each direction, so the result is that

1:06:41.580,1:06:45.540
both goombas are warped to the point halfway 
between their original positions and the HOLP.

1:06:46.200,1:06:49.680
Another important detail is that 
this repositioning is only done

1:06:49.680,1:06:54.720
along the horizontal plane. The vertical 
position is completely unaffected. So,

1:06:54.720,1:06:56.640
if the HOLP is at a different vertical position,

1:06:56.640,1:07:01.560
both goombas will end up halfway to the HOLP in 
the X and Z coordinates, but while the goomba

1:07:01.560,1:07:06.060
clone ends up at the HOLP’s Y coordinate, the 
other goomba remains at its original Y position.

1:07:06.840,1:07:12.420
This glitch allowed for two major breakthroughs 
in cloning capabilities. It was now possible,

1:07:12.420,1:07:17.460
albeit very restrictive and convoluted, to release 
a clone at a location otherwise inaccessible,

1:07:17.460,1:07:21.840
without the situational hat in hand glitch. 
Although, because Mario needs to be close

1:07:21.840,1:07:24.720
enough to the goomba trio for them 
to be loaded in the first place,

1:07:24.720,1:07:28.920
there would be very few situations where 
transport cloning actually enabled new

1:07:28.920,1:07:33.180
clone locations. The most valuable 
benefit was the ability to release

1:07:33.180,1:07:37.440
the clone just far enough away from Mario 
that he doesn’t immediately bump into it.

1:07:37.980,1:07:43.140
Pannenkoek figured that this new technique 
would prove useful in Bowser in the Sky. Despite

1:07:43.140,1:07:48.480
Pannen’s hard work, that stage was still sitting 
at 10 A presses. First, he found that luring a

1:07:48.480,1:07:53.880
goomba to the edge of this bridge barely allowed 
him to skip past that gap without using A. Next,

1:07:53.880,1:07:58.920
he found a use for transport cloning. He released 
a clone here while these two goombas over there

1:07:58.920,1:08:04.140
were running into each other. This warped both 
goombas halfway to Mario, with the clone partly

1:08:04.140,1:08:09.360
in the ground because of Mario’s lower position. 
Afterwards, he used the fact that goomba clones do

1:08:09.360,1:08:14.520
still have collision with other goombas. He guided 
a goomba to push the clone all the way to the

1:08:14.520,1:08:18.960
other side, where Mario could bounce on it after 
getting the final red coin, saving an A press.

1:08:19.560,1:08:25.080
Pannen was not done in this level. His next 
endeavour was to save the A press needed to

1:08:25.080,1:08:29.880
jump into the pipe to the Bowser fight. The main 
issue here was that to bring a goomba clone all

1:08:29.880,1:08:34.020
the way to the pipe, he would need to be able to 
get there while holding an object. The closest

1:08:34.020,1:08:38.460
bob-omb to clone with is all the way down there, 
and because holding an object severely hinders

1:08:38.460,1:08:42.840
Mario’s movement options, that meant Pannen 
needed many more clones to cross small gaps

1:08:42.840,1:08:47.280
that would otherwise be trivial. So, while he 
only needed a single goomba clone at the pipe,

1:08:47.280,1:08:52.080
the many gaps along the way basically acted as 
one big deconstructed goomba bridge of length

1:08:52.080,1:08:59.220
7. At 127 goombas, that’s way too much to make 
this a viable strategy. And that’s before even

1:08:59.220,1:09:03.180
considering the fact that without the hat in 
hand glitch and remote release, there was no

1:09:03.180,1:09:07.800
way he could release all of these clones without 
interacting with them. It seemed impossible.

1:09:07.800,1:09:12.720
Until he found something new. As 
it turns out, on any given frame,

1:09:12.720,1:09:17.820
Mario can only interact with a single object at 
a time. If Mario is colliding with more than one

1:09:17.820,1:09:22.320
goomba at the same time, whichever comes first in 
the processing order is the one that is handled,

1:09:22.320,1:09:25.620
and the other collisions will be 
ignored. And here’s the key part:

1:09:25.620,1:09:29.280
when a clone’s interaction status 
is broken and it becomes intangible,

1:09:29.280,1:09:33.300
Mario still technically interacts with it 
when they collide, even if nothing happens.

1:09:33.300,1:09:38.820
The processing order of a group of clones is 
the same as the order they were generated in.

1:09:38.820,1:09:43.560
So, if Mario releases a goomba clone and bumps 
into it, he can then come back and release a new

1:09:43.560,1:09:48.360
clone inside of the first clone’s hitbox. 
Because Mario is touching the first clone,

1:09:48.360,1:09:53.220
this is the interaction that is being handled. 
But because that clone is now in a broken state,

1:09:53.220,1:09:57.840
nothing comes out of this interaction. Although 
he is also colliding with the second clone,

1:09:57.840,1:10:01.380
this collision is ignored. So, he 
can come back and bounce on the

1:10:01.380,1:10:04.620
part of the second clone’s hitbox that 
doesn’t overlap with the first clone,

1:10:04.620,1:10:09.780
and he has successfully released a useable clone 
without remote release nor transport cloning.

1:10:09.780,1:10:14.220
There are two caveats. First, this 
method does require one clone to

1:10:14.220,1:10:18.540
use as a sacrifice to place another clone. 
But once the blood tribute has been paid,

1:10:18.540,1:10:22.800
older broken clones that were productive 
can allow Mario to release newer clones at

1:10:22.800,1:10:28.140
no additional cost. Second, the interaction 
priority goes both ways: Mario can’t bounce

1:10:28.140,1:10:32.280
on a goomba if he’s busy interacting with 
another goomba. He needs to release that

1:10:32.280,1:10:36.060
second goomba in such a way that there’s a 
portion of its hitbox that’s sticking out of

1:10:36.060,1:10:41.160
the first goomba’s hitbox. This tiny section 
becomes the second goomba’s effective hitbox.

1:10:41.160,1:10:46.500
So, this new find was great to place clones at 
arbitrary locations, but what about the problem

1:10:46.500,1:10:51.900
of having to clone over a hundred goombas when the 
game can only render about 40 at once? That one

1:10:51.900,1:10:57.060
was solved thanks to transport cloning and clone 
pushing. Goombas needed for the fourth step of the

1:10:57.060,1:11:02.100
bridge could be released remotely, then pushed 
into position by other goombas. This cut the

1:11:02.100,1:11:07.320
use of the second and third steps of the bridge by 
half. Finally, the last step of the bridge was the

1:11:07.320,1:11:11.700
goomba next to the pipe, and it could be bounced 
on without having to go and rebuild the rest of

1:11:11.700,1:11:17.460
the goomba bridge again, cutting the total number 
of clones in half once more. Pannen’s complex plan

1:11:17.460,1:11:23.880
balanced convenience and minimizing the number 
of clones used. In total, 61 goomba clones ended

1:11:23.880,1:11:29.160
up being used for this A press save, plus two 
more for the final red coin. This stretched

1:11:29.160,1:11:33.960
the game to its very limit, and he ran into 
many crashes while TASing this stage, but with

1:11:33.960,1:11:38.400
the right camera angles to minimize the amount of 
goombas on screen at once, it was indeed possible.

1:11:38.400,1:11:44.220
Finally, one last improvement was made in Bowser 
in the Sky. But this time, there was something

1:11:44.220,1:11:50.280
different. It was not made by Pannenkoek, 
but by someone new. His name was Gaehne D.

1:11:50.280,1:11:54.420
Gaehne D. started watching Pannen’s 
videos even before the A Button Challenge,

1:11:54.420,1:11:59.640
and he had grown fascinated by them. He messaged 
Pannenkoek through the YouTube inbox system,

1:11:59.640,1:12:03.900
and after some back and forth, they started 
bouncing ideas for improving the A Button

1:12:03.900,1:12:08.760
Challenge. One of those ideas Gaehne D. brought 
to the table was a very precise double jump

1:12:08.760,1:12:13.620
kick to clear the first two platforms in a 
single A press instead of two. After a lot

1:12:13.620,1:12:18.600
of testing helped by another guy by the name of 
Wizdoodle, this A press save was proven possible,

1:12:18.600,1:12:23.580
bringing down Bowser in the Sky from 10 A 
presses down to 6 over the course of a few weeks.

1:12:23.580,1:12:29.520
Around that same time, another A press was saved, 
this time in Jolly Roger Bay. Through the Jet

1:12:29.520,1:12:33.420
Stream had always been fairly straightforward: 
one A press to break the metal cap box,

1:12:33.420,1:12:38.040
and one A press to jump into the star with the 
metal cap. But Pannen found that the first one

1:12:38.040,1:12:42.240
could be skipped thanks to an old technique 
that I haven’t discussed yet: pause buffering.

1:12:42.780,1:12:48.060
When Mario dives with B, as soon as he hits the 
ground, he can do a dive recover, either with B or

1:12:48.060,1:12:53.160
A. If he’s on a steep enough slope, he actually 
hits the ground on the very next frame after

1:12:53.160,1:12:58.860
he dives. As soon as he does, though, he very 
quickly loses forward momentum. So, each frame

1:12:58.860,1:13:04.320
spent sliding after a dive takes out a big chunk 
of speed. In normal circumstances, you could dive

1:13:04.320,1:13:09.540
with B on one frame, and press A to recover on the 
next, that’s not a particularly alluring strategy

1:13:09.540,1:13:14.760
here. Because both the dive and the dive recover 
have to be done with B, there has to be at least

1:13:14.760,1:13:20.040
one frame where B is released between them, which 
causes Mario to lose part of his speed. But while

1:13:20.040,1:13:24.300
the game is paused, the physics engine doesn’t 
advance, yet controller inputs are still being

1:13:24.300,1:13:30.120
read. So, by pausing the game while B is released, 
Mario can dive on one frame, pause and release B,

1:13:30.120,1:13:35.760
unpause and repress B, and recover on the next 
frame. This let him keep all of his forward speed,

1:13:35.760,1:13:39.300
which was just enough to make it onto 
the metal cap box and save an A press.

1:13:40.260,1:13:45.480
In Hazy Maze Cave, for Metal Head Mario Can 
Move, Gaehne D. came up with another enemy lure,

1:13:45.480,1:13:48.660
this time with a scuttlebug to skip 
one of the gaps and save an A press.

1:13:49.440,1:13:54.420
Meanwhile though, Pannenkoek was working on 
something far more advanced. He theorized

1:13:54.420,1:13:59.460
something quite insane, in Tick Tock Clock: what 
if you could skip the final A press of Timed

1:13:59.460,1:14:04.980
Jumps on Moving Bars? This would be incredibly 
challenging, because while there are bob-ombs at

1:14:04.980,1:14:10.020
the very bottom of the stage, there is nothing 
useful to clone with them. The star is encased

1:14:10.020,1:14:14.400
in a solid cage, with no features around it 
that could be used to- wait, what? You can

1:14:14.400,1:14:19.380
simply dive recover into it? Oops, well I guess 
that one slipped through the cracks somehow.

1:14:20.220,1:14:27.060
The date is now May 2014. Pannen’s next target 
is Bowser in the Fire Sea. When getting the red

1:14:27.060,1:14:32.400
coins, Mario has to climb the pole twice, because 
this coin forces him to fall back down. The only

1:14:32.400,1:14:37.860
way to get off the pole and onto the higher 
platform is to jump off of it. Or is it? In

1:14:37.860,1:14:43.200
the first round trip, yes, definitely, there’s no 
possible way around it. But after getting up once,

1:14:43.200,1:14:48.540
the entire level is unlocked, which contains 
bob-ombs! Pannen carried an unloaded bob-omb

1:14:48.540,1:14:53.580
all the way back down here, where he could clone 
one of the lower goombas. Using transport cloning,

1:14:53.580,1:14:58.440
he was able to safely release a clone right 
next to the pole. So that would allow him to

1:14:58.440,1:15:03.300
drop off from the pole using Z and bounce to the 
platform, right? If only it were that simple.

1:15:03.300,1:15:09.540
When Mario drops off from a pole, he has barely 
any horizontal momentum. So little, in fact,

1:15:09.540,1:15:14.280
that one goomba bounce isn’t even enough to 
cross this minuscule distance. Using more

1:15:14.280,1:15:18.840
clones didn’t help either because he couldn’t 
even place them low enough for it to work. He

1:15:18.840,1:15:24.480
had to resort to something better: setting 
Mario on fire. Burning Mario actually has a

1:15:24.480,1:15:28.920
very useful component to it: it makes him 
do a little hop forward. This is actually

1:15:28.920,1:15:33.180
enough to reach the platform from the pole. 
The only problem is finding a way to burn

1:15:33.180,1:15:37.380
Mario at the top of the pole. Luckily, 
fire spitters are there to save the day.

1:15:37.380,1:15:43.560
These fire bars are made up of 15 individual 
flames, each taking up one object slot. When the

1:15:43.560,1:15:48.600
fire comes out, all of these flames are loaded, 
then unloaded as they stop burning. If Mario is

1:15:48.600,1:15:52.740
holding a vacant object slot when the flames 
come out, he can end up holding a flame clone.

1:15:52.740,1:15:57.900
To release it, however, Pannenkoek couldn’t use 
transport cloning, because nothing can push fire,

1:15:57.900,1:16:03.360
so he had to use the old knockback strategy by 
positioning a goomba at the right spot. Finally,

1:16:03.360,1:16:07.560
he also had to place more goomba clones so that 
he could bounce from the elevator to this spot,

1:16:07.560,1:16:11.340
so that the flame would be placed high 
enough for this strategy to work. After

1:16:11.340,1:16:14.760
falling down to get the red coin, he 
dismounted the pole by getting burned,

1:16:14.760,1:16:19.200
and he managed to get back up without an 
A press. This meant the only A press left

1:16:19.200,1:16:22.500
in this level was the one required to 
get off the pole the first time around.

1:16:23.340,1:16:28.680
The next A press to be saved wasn’t tied to any 
star in particular: it was the A press required

1:16:28.680,1:16:34.620
to enter Cavern of the Metal Cap. This one was 
simple, but quite precise to pull off. After

1:16:34.620,1:16:38.760
getting Dorrie in the right spot, Mario can reach 
the platform with a run up and a dive recover.

1:16:39.480,1:16:42.960
Coincidentally, the very next day, 
Pannenkoek found another improvement,

1:16:42.960,1:16:47.160
again in castle movement. This time, 
it was pounding the pillars to lower

1:16:47.160,1:16:51.000
the water and access the Vanish 
Cap course. After catching MIPS,

1:16:51.000,1:16:55.560
Pannen carried it all the way to the pillars. 
Here, he got off the pillar holding MIPS but

1:16:55.560,1:16:59.940
ground pounded. This instantly releases 
MIPS, which in turn pushes Mario back

1:16:59.940,1:17:05.040
onto the pillar. Rinse and repeat for the other 
pillar, and two more A presses had been saved.

1:17:05.580,1:17:09.600
At the same time, Pannen also found a way 
to get Secret of the Haunted Books from 2

1:17:09.600,1:17:13.920
down to only 1 A press. The A press to get 
to the second floor was still unavoidable,

1:17:13.920,1:17:18.240
but the second one to jump into the star 
wasn’t. Here though, it wasn’t as simple

1:17:18.240,1:17:22.860
as a dive recover. Instead, he had to dive 
recover onto the railing, which has a tiny

1:17:22.860,1:17:27.720
slippery slope on top of it. Immediately after 
sliding off, he clips back in and ground pounds,

1:17:27.720,1:17:32.460
having just enough height to touch the star. 
But how did he manage to clip back in like that?

1:17:32.460,1:17:38.400
Well, the answer is complicated. Not complicated 
enough to make a fascinating 2-hour documentary

1:17:38.400,1:17:42.300
about- oh of course it is. So, we’re 
gonna simplify things for the time being.

1:17:42.300,1:17:47.820
The railing’s cross section looks like this. 
This is the inside wall, the outside wall,

1:17:47.820,1:17:53.820
and the slippery slope on top. Now, wall hitboxes 
have multiple interesting properties. They extend

1:17:53.820,1:17:58.740
laterally by 50 units on each side of the wall. 
In the case of a thin railing like this one,

1:17:58.740,1:18:02.340
the hitboxes can stick out of 
the other side like this. Also,

1:18:02.340,1:18:07.200
wall hitboxes only extend vertically up to 
30 units below the top of the wall. Because

1:18:07.200,1:18:12.060
the inside wall extends higher than the outside 
one, this section of inside wall hitbox sticks

1:18:12.060,1:18:17.040
out and ends up pushing Mario back in from the 
other side. This is the spot Pannenkoek hit to

1:18:17.040,1:18:21.480
make this A press save work. At the time, he 
wasn’t fully aware of all of these mechanics,

1:18:21.480,1:18:24.360
and simply referred to it as glitching 
to the other side of the railing.

1:18:25.380,1:18:30.240
Another level that saw an improvement around 
this time is Rainbow Ride. The red coin star

1:18:30.240,1:18:34.260
was already down to 2 A presses, one 
for each of the two trips to the maze.

1:18:34.260,1:18:38.280
An obvious way to improve that would be to 
cut it down to a single trip to the maze

1:18:38.280,1:18:43.740
that somehow gets all 8 red coins in one go. 
And that’s what Pannen did. He managed to do

1:18:43.740,1:18:48.240
it by activating the elevator and taking it 
back up, and with this precise dive recover.

1:18:48.240,1:18:53.760
But then, he found something bigger. The carpet 
trip to the top of the maze was essential,

1:18:53.760,1:18:58.080
but the A press needed in it seemed very 
close to being skippable. He figured that

1:18:58.080,1:19:01.680
if he could have just one small bounce, he 
could have the height needed to grab this

1:19:01.680,1:19:06.300
ledge without an A press. And he solved it with 
the most advanced enemy luring strategy yet:

1:19:06.300,1:19:12.600
the Lakitu lure. He led Lakitu far away while he 
was still low, then deactivated it until the last

1:19:12.600,1:19:17.760
moment. Deactivation works differently than 
unloading does. When Mario is too far away,

1:19:17.760,1:19:21.780
Lakitu is no longer rendered and updated, 
but it remains at the same position until

1:19:21.780,1:19:26.220
Mario gets near it again. Because Lakitu 
takes a while to rise up to Mario’s height,

1:19:26.220,1:19:30.840
Pannen was able to get it to fly up into him just 
in time to get enough height to grab the ledge.

1:19:30.840,1:19:34.920
As it turns out, the Lakitu lure saved 
the final A press in the red coin star,

1:19:34.920,1:19:39.480
but it also saved one of the four A presses 
for Big House in the Sky, which also shares

1:19:39.480,1:19:46.800
this carpet ride. And just like that, the total A 
press count for all 120 stars was now under 100.

1:19:46.800,1:19:52.260
But there was no time for celebration: there 
were more A presses to save. In Dire Dire Docks,

1:19:52.260,1:19:56.580
the convoluted red coin star went 
from 3.5 to 2.5 when Pannen found

1:19:56.580,1:20:00.060
that he could activate the boxes switch, 
and drop from the pole clone onto a box

1:20:00.060,1:20:03.900
instead of jumping off. This one was 
actually more precise than it looks,

1:20:03.900,1:20:08.340
again because Mario has almost zero horizontal 
momentum when he drops off from a pole.

1:20:08.340,1:20:13.440
Following the theme of improving upon already 
complex stars, Pannen then came up with an insane

1:20:13.440,1:20:18.780
idea to improve the downtown stars of Wet-Dry 
World. This was perhaps the most creative and

1:20:18.780,1:20:24.000
bizarre looking strategy yet. Thanks to 
its 14-hour water level manipulation epic,

1:20:24.000,1:20:29.340
the red coin star was already at 0 A presses, but 
Quick race through Downtown still required one A

1:20:29.340,1:20:33.720
press to complete. That is until Pannenkoek 
somehow thought of raising the water level

1:20:33.720,1:20:38.880
so much, for so long, that it would reach 
a value too large for the game to handle.

1:20:38.880,1:20:43.860
The water level is stored as a 16-bit 
signed integer. In other words, it can

1:20:43.860,1:20:51.600
only be a whole number from negative 32 thousand 
to positive 32 thousand. If it goes beyond 32767,

1:20:51.600,1:20:57.960
the water level quite literally overflows. So it 
wraps around to negative 32 thousand, essentially

1:20:57.960,1:21:03.720
making the downtown area go from completely filled 
with water to completely dry instantly. And now,

1:21:03.720,1:21:08.220
the genius part: because the water level bob 
up and down, if the median is right around the

1:21:08.220,1:21:12.900
overflow limit, the water level can switch back 
and forth between its maximum and minimum values,

1:21:12.900,1:21:17.820
overflowing and underflowing every two 
seconds. Now that’s a Wet-Dry World.

1:21:17.820,1:21:23.700
The result looks very weird: Mario swims for a 
bit, then starts falling, then becomes underwater

1:21:23.700,1:21:29.040
again, over and over. And this double state is 
exactly what Pannen needed to bypass the need

1:21:29.040,1:21:33.960
for an A press in Quick Race through Downtown. 
Also, although time is very much a secondary

1:21:33.960,1:21:38.280
concern in this challenge, this solution 
saved about 3 hours for the red coin star.

1:21:38.940,1:21:44.520
After this string of improvements, Pannenkoek took 
a bit of a break until mid-June. In the meantime,

1:21:44.520,1:21:49.320
though, he worked on a project dear to him since 
his very beginnings with this game: a video on the

1:21:49.320,1:21:55.200
255 coin limit. Over the years, Pannen had made 
dozens of videos about glitches and other Mario

1:21:55.200,1:22:00.660
science, but this one was special. For the very 
first time, the whole world could hear his voice.

1:22:00.660,1:22:08.520
[Pannenkoek: Hey guys! It’s-a me, pannenkoek2012; 
bringing you Dutch pancakes since 2010.]

1:22:08.520,1:22:12.180
This video didn’t bring anything new 
for the A Button Challenge specifically,

1:22:12.180,1:22:16.380
although it did show the lengths he was ready 
to go to just to get one extra coin in Tick

1:22:16.380,1:22:21.480
Tock Clock. The response from the community was so 
positive that he decided that from this point on,

1:22:21.480,1:22:26.460
glitch explanations and other science videos would 
become commentated. But because A Button Challenge

1:22:26.460,1:22:31.440
videos were mostly demonstrations of a strategy, 
he felt little incentive to provide additional

1:22:31.440,1:22:35.220
commentary other than the video description, 
and kept them in the same format as before.

1:22:36.000,1:22:40.800
When Pannen came back to the A Button Challenge, 
he found an A press save to go to Bowser in the

1:22:40.800,1:22:46.020
Sky, which always required two A presses to get 
up the steps. After exiting either Rainbow Ride

1:22:46.020,1:22:50.340
or Wing Mario over the Rainbow, it could be done 
in only one with a slidekick bounce and a dive

1:22:50.340,1:22:55.109
grind double jump kick up three steps at once. 
How does that skateboard trick sounding move work?

1:22:55.109,1:22:55.560
To first understand why dive grinding works, we 
need to understand why grinding in general works.

1:22:55.560,1:23:00.540
If you’ve played this game before, you’ve 
probably encountered this situation. This

1:23:00.540,1:23:05.400
happens because ground movement and air movement 
are fundamentally different. On the ground,

1:23:05.400,1:23:09.420
Mario is pretty much always moving in the 
direction that he’s facing. In the air,

1:23:09.420,1:23:13.920
Mario’s movement is defined by his speed and 
facing angle as well, but it is also influenced

1:23:13.920,1:23:18.840
by the direction of the control stick. If Mario is 
facing slightly away from a ledge, but the control

1:23:18.840,1:23:22.890
stick is held towards the platform, he will 
move off of it while on the ground, and back on

1:23:22.890,1:23:28.140
to it once he’s in the air. This results in Mario 
oscillating between being on and off the platform.

1:23:28.140,1:23:33.300
It doesn’t look like it here, but Mario is facing 
ever so slightly away from the platform. When

1:23:33.300,1:23:38.580
he walks off, he enters a freefall state. In 
freefall, Mario can dive no matter his speed.

1:23:38.580,1:23:43.620
He dives, but the joystick is held towards the 
step, so on the very next frame, he moves back

1:23:43.620,1:23:48.840
onto the step. But now, because he’s facing away, 
he slides back off the platform and into freefall

1:23:48.840,1:23:55.140
again. Each time Mario dives, it adds a flat 15 
to his speed, up to a maximum of 48, which is 50%

1:23:55.140,1:24:01.800
more than running speed. So, with four consecutive 
dives, he gets his speed up to 48. Then, he enters

1:24:01.800,1:24:06.780
freefall for a frame, and lands again. When Mario 
lands from a freefall, he can immediately double

1:24:06.780,1:24:11.520
jump. Because the vertical speed of a jump is 
influenced by the horizontal speed, and because

1:24:11.520,1:24:16.440
a double jump has a higher vertical speed than 
a single jump, a 48 speed double jump kick gives

1:24:16.440,1:24:20.160
him just enough height and distance to make it 
all the way up the stairs in a single A press.

1:24:21.000,1:24:26.580
Next, Pannenkoek looked at the 100-coin star in 
Hazy Maze Cave. It took one A press to ground

1:24:26.580,1:24:30.420
pound the switch for blue coins, but with 
clever swooper bounces, he could reach 100

1:24:30.420,1:24:34.740
different coins with only that one A press. 
That is until he found a way to ground pound

1:24:34.740,1:24:40.020
the switch without having to jump. How could 
he do that? Again, the answer was swoopers.

1:24:40.020,1:24:44.340
However, using swoopers to ground pound 
the blue switch meant that he no longer

1:24:44.340,1:24:48.480
could use them to reach the Navigating 
the Toxic Maze alcove. Because of that,

1:24:48.480,1:24:53.820
he missed out on too many coins to get 100 without 
an A press. But thankfully, he could still combine

1:24:53.820,1:24:58.800
it with the red coin star and get both of them 
for one A press total, instead of one for each.

1:24:58.800,1:25:01.980
Next up was Chip Off Whomp’s 
Block. If you remember,

1:25:01.980,1:25:05.940
this star was left at one A press last 
time because Pannenkoek couldn’t find a

1:25:05.940,1:25:10.380
way to get Mario to the star without jumping. 
Well, if he couldn’t bring Mario to the star,

1:25:10.380,1:25:14.760
why not bring the star to Mario? That’s 
right: he could do it via cloning!

1:25:14.760,1:25:19.980
Now, it’s easy to say, just clone the star, but 
it’s actually not that simple. Up until this

1:25:19.980,1:25:24.120
point, the only way Pannen managed to clone a star 
was by carrying objects through loading zones,

1:25:24.120,1:25:28.560
but Dire Dire Docks and Wet-Dry World are the 
only two levels in the game that have a loading

1:25:28.560,1:25:33.420
zone. The issue is that without a loading zone, 
stars are always loaded no matter how far Mario

1:25:33.420,1:25:38.040
is from them, so they can’t load into an object 
slot that he’s currently holding. But here,

1:25:38.040,1:25:42.120
because the star appears after the fight with 
King Whomp, it could theoretically load into

1:25:42.120,1:25:45.960
Mario’s hands if he was holding the correct 
vacant object slot right at that moment.

1:25:45.960,1:25:50.820
As far as holding a vacant object slot goes, 
Pannen knew it was possible to get a hold of

1:25:50.820,1:25:55.020
an unloaded cork box by bringing it all the way 
up to the top, and having King Whomp break the

1:25:55.020,1:26:00.000
box while grabbing it at the right time. There’s 
a major problem with keeping that unloaded box,

1:26:00.000,1:26:03.420
though. To end the fight, Mario 
needs to ground pound King Whomp,

1:26:03.420,1:26:08.220
which is incompatible with holding an object. 
It was time for new technology to step in.

1:26:11.400,1:26:17.133
This strategy was actually months in the making. 
Back in 2013, Pannenkoek had discovered hands

1:26:17.133,1:26:21.060
free holding, a state in which Mario is no 
longer in the action of holding an object,

1:26:21.060,1:26:25.980
but he still has a held object with him. It 
can be triggered by a few specific actions,

1:26:25.980,1:26:31.260
like diving into a downwards slope, or bonking 
into a ceiling. This is a volatile state with

1:26:31.260,1:26:35.640
many restrictions: in short, Mario is trying 
to get rid of the object, so he has to be kept

1:26:35.640,1:26:40.440
constantly busy to keep him from dropping it. 
This is usually done by jumping repeatedly,

1:26:40.440,1:26:46.440
but that’s not an option here. I’ll leave figuring 
out why as an exercise for the viewer. Instead,

1:26:46.440,1:26:51.540
Pannen had to get creative. First, he triggers 
the hands free holding glitch by bonking into

1:26:51.540,1:26:55.380
the bottom of King Whomp, which, at 
this moment, acts as a ceiling. Then,

1:26:55.380,1:26:59.280
he punches repeatedly to avoid dropping the 
unloaded box until he’s in the right position

1:26:59.280,1:27:03.360
to ground pound King Whomp while holding 
a specific vacant slot, which the star

1:27:03.360,1:27:08.460
loads into. And this finally brought down 
Chip Off Whomp’s Block to zero A presses.

1:27:08.460,1:27:13.320
Around the same time, Pannenkoek also 
posted a video about trying to clone

1:27:13.320,1:27:17.340
blue coins. While he tried very hard 
to make it happen, he just couldn’t

1:27:17.340,1:27:21.780
get it to work. [Pannenkoek: It doesn’t really 
work. I just get stuck in some sort of limbo

1:27:21.780,1:27:25.920
world.] This goes to show that even though 
so many breakthroughs were made in that era,

1:27:25.920,1:27:29.820
a lot of the research still ended up in 
a dead end with nothing useful gained.

1:27:29.820,1:27:32.520
Also, Pannen started posting some lower effort

1:27:32.520,1:27:36.540
videos for testing ideas and documenting 
strategies over on a secondary channel,

1:27:36.540,1:27:41.820
aptly named Pannenkeok2012. I’m 
sure that’s not gonna be confusing.

1:27:42.840,1:27:47.340
July 2014. It had been a good 
two weeks since Whomp’s Fortress,

1:27:47.340,1:27:51.780
so it was time for more breakthroughs. The 
ascent up the rotating red coin platforms

1:27:51.780,1:27:54.420
in Tick Tock Clock, which was 
done in 0 A presses before,

1:27:54.420,1:28:00.240
was now found to be possible in 0 A presses. But 
this time, while holding an unloaded bob-omb!

1:28:00.240,1:28:04.920
Pannenkoek found that by entering the clock on 
the random setting and by manipulating the RNG,

1:28:04.920,1:28:10.200
he was able to get all the way up these platforms 
safely while holding an unloaded object. This let

1:28:10.200,1:28:15.420
him clone a bob-omb up here. The old strategy 
for Roll into the Cage was a sideflip wallkick

1:28:15.420,1:28:19.740
from down here to get up in two A presses. 
But with a bob-omb and a single A press,

1:28:19.740,1:28:25.140
Pannen was able to use the bloated bob-omb glitch 
to get up the cogs without using A again. The

1:28:25.140,1:28:29.640
strategy involves hands free holding, triggered 
here by being pushed off the platform while belly

1:28:29.640,1:28:33.600
sliding and holding the bob-omb, and a lot of 
ground pounding, which, during its animation,

1:28:33.600,1:28:39.000
temporarily disables collision checks with floors 
and most of its checks against walls. This is

1:28:39.000,1:28:44.040
usually fine, when Mario isn’t being pushed around 
during the ground pound. But here, it allows him

1:28:44.040,1:28:48.000
to clip inside the cogs and pop up on top of 
them when the ground pound animation is over.

1:28:48.000,1:28:53.700
This route involved some seriously crazy movement 
because Mario can’t hold on to the bloated bob-omb

1:28:53.700,1:28:58.200
for more than a few frames at once. Thanks to 
the bob-omb having four different bloated sizes,

1:28:58.200,1:29:01.620
he could grab it at slightly different 
intervals and have it be smaller if he

1:29:01.620,1:29:05.760
wanted to position Mario, and larger if he 
wanted a stronger push to cross large gaps.

1:29:05.760,1:29:08.940
This allowed him to get all the way 
to the star and save an A press,

1:29:08.940,1:29:13.680
but he still needed one more to jump 
into the star itself. Or did he?

1:29:13.680,1:29:19.380
Five days after posting this video, it was already 
outdated. It turns out that the bob-omb can still

1:29:19.380,1:29:24.480
be useful even here. In its most bloated 
state, it displaces Mario by so much that

1:29:24.480,1:29:28.980
it’s possible to clip outside of the cage, and 
with a ground pound, onto this ramp. From there,

1:29:28.980,1:29:33.960
he was able to clip back in, but high enough 
to grab the star without jumping into it. But

1:29:33.960,1:29:38.700
this new find was bigger than that. Reaching this 
ramp had only been done in two A presses before.

1:29:38.700,1:29:44.340
Therefore, this new bob-omb strategy saved an 
A press in three more Tick Tock Clock stars.

1:29:44.940,1:29:50.220
The next new technical development was for 
Metal Head Mario can Move. Three months prior,

1:29:50.220,1:29:54.180
a scuttlebug had been used to save an 
A press and bring it down to 2. Well,

1:29:54.180,1:29:58.500
it was time for that little bug to put in more 
work and take out the rest of the A presses!

1:29:58.500,1:30:03.900
The first step was to make the scuttlebug jump 
out of the pit. But then, Mario goes back out.

1:30:03.900,1:30:08.940
As Mario leaves the room, the scuttlebug 
is deactivated, but not unloaded. Again,

1:30:08.940,1:30:14.040
this means that it remains where it is, but it’s 
no longer being updated or drawn. When Mario goes

1:30:14.040,1:30:18.660
near it again, it will reappear in exactly 
the same spot. This will be useful later.

1:30:19.320,1:30:24.780
The main development that made this improvement 
possible was found by Plush. It’s similar to shell

1:30:24.780,1:30:30.180
hyperspeed. When pressing C-up while facing 
slightly downwards on a steep slope, Mario is

1:30:30.180,1:30:34.920
trying to come to a stop, but the downwards slope 
accelerates him straight ahead instead. Again,

1:30:34.920,1:30:40.080
because the slope is so steep, his de facto 
speed is a small fraction of his real speed. Now,

1:30:40.080,1:30:45.120
when Mario enters water, he loses all of 
that speed. Except, he actually doesn’t.

1:30:45.660,1:30:49.560
Horizontal speed in Super Mario 64 
is handled in two different ways:

1:30:49.560,1:30:54.780
the regular speed and the sliding speed. The 
regular speed is a single value that is applied

1:30:54.780,1:31:00.840
to Mario’s current facing angle to move him. It’s 
used in most scenarios: running, jumping, falling,

1:31:00.840,1:31:05.760
taking damage, and many more. The sliding 
speed is fundamentally different: it’s a

1:31:05.760,1:31:10.680
vector with an X and a Z component. The resulting 
direction isn’t necessarily Mario’s facing angle.

1:31:11.220,1:31:16.860
As its name suggests, the sliding speed is used 
while Mario is sliding, no matter where or how.

1:31:16.860,1:31:20.640
Even though only one type of speed is 
used at a time, in most circumstances,

1:31:20.640,1:31:26.100
the unused speed is always updated to reflect the 
one that’s being used. When Mario is not sliding,

1:31:26.100,1:31:30.720
the sliding speed vector is updated to reflect 
Mario’s regular speed and angle, and when he is

1:31:30.720,1:31:35.040
sliding, the regular speed is updated to reflect 
the amplitude of the sliding speed vector.

1:31:35.040,1:31:39.240
But there are situations where the regular 
speed is updated while the sliding speed

1:31:39.240,1:31:44.040
isn’t. As it turns out, swimming is one of 
them. While Mario is moving down the slope,

1:31:44.040,1:31:48.600
his sliding speed increases, and his normal 
speed follows. When he falls in the water,

1:31:48.600,1:31:52.860
his normal speed drops back to 0, but his 
sliding speed doesn’t update to match it,

1:31:52.860,1:31:57.180
so it stays high. Now, he can go back on 
the slope and immediately start sliding,

1:31:57.180,1:32:02.400
which uses the sliding speed. That speed is still 
high from the previous slide, and it goes even

1:32:02.400,1:32:08.520
higher. Pannen repeats this until the sliding 
speed goes all the way up to 496. At this point,

1:32:08.520,1:32:13.560
Mario has so much speed that he can bypass the 
entire wall hitbox without even colliding with it.

1:32:13.560,1:32:19.980
That threshold is 400 speed in most cases. Now, 
all he needs to do is wait for Dorrie to show up,

1:32:19.980,1:32:24.360
and use it to instantly start sliding out of the 
water, as well as to gain some precious height.

1:32:24.360,1:32:29.100
And this is where the scuttlebug comes 
into play. As soon as it is reactivated,

1:32:29.100,1:32:34.200
Mario goes buttsliding onto it with so much 
speed that one single bounce gets him all the

1:32:34.200,1:32:39.900
way across to the star. And that is how Metal 
Head Mario Can Move was dropped to 0 A presses.

1:32:40.860,1:32:44.280
While all of this was happening, 
another level was being worked on:

1:32:44.280,1:32:49.320
the eternal Bowser in the Sky. It had 
been left at 6 A presses back in April,

1:32:49.320,1:32:53.580
but Pannen had been slowly chipping away at 
it with incremental improvements for 6 weeks,

1:32:53.580,1:32:58.080
from late June to August 3rd. This is 
everything he accomplished in that period.

1:32:58.080,1:33:03.360
First, one A press was saved using black 
magic. What’s going on here is actually

1:33:03.360,1:33:06.000
not new. In his first run through the challenge,

1:33:06.000,1:33:09.960
Pannen had already abused this mechanic 
to save an A press in a higher elevator,

1:33:09.960,1:33:15.720
perhaps without even realizing it. But how does 
that work? Simply because this thing is stupid.

1:33:17.940,1:33:23.100
Have you ever run into weird wonkiness on one of 
these elevators before? Have you ever bumped into

1:33:23.100,1:33:28.620
nothingness, or been squished out of nowhere? 
Here’s why: the axle rotates around its center,

1:33:28.620,1:33:33.240
but its hitbox is incorrectly anchored 
at one of its tips instead. And that is

1:33:33.240,1:33:38.160
the reason behind all of this weird behaviour, 
including both of these A press-saving moves.

1:33:39.120,1:33:44.280
The second A press save came in the middle of 
the level. This red coin always required an A

1:33:44.280,1:33:49.320
press to grab, but theoretically, Mario could also 
collect it by falling from above. Unfortunately,

1:33:49.320,1:33:54.600
because getting off this pole also requires 
an A press, it wasn’t any better to do so. But

1:33:54.600,1:33:59.220
Pannenkoek figured out that using goomba clones, 
it would be possible to dismount the pole without

1:33:59.220,1:34:04.380
using A. Because the cloning had to be done over 
here, which is past the pole, he did have to use

1:34:04.380,1:34:09.480
A once to dismount it the first time. But then, 
he could clone goombas, drop down to the red coin,

1:34:09.480,1:34:13.260
and climb back up, using the goomba clones 
to dismount the pole without using A again.

1:34:13.260,1:34:17.760
After some testing, he quickly realized 
that because Mario’s momentum is so low

1:34:17.760,1:34:22.560
when dropping off from the pole, his best course 
of action was to take damage instead. He managed

1:34:22.560,1:34:26.580
to do it by manipulating another goomba to 
push the clone under Mario to damage him,

1:34:26.580,1:34:29.880
while falling into position so that 
Mario could bounce on it during the

1:34:29.880,1:34:34.680
damage knockback. That worked, and so Bowser 
in the Sky was down to only 4 A presses:

1:34:34.680,1:34:39.000
two at the start, one to get this red coin, and 
one to get off the pole the first time around.

1:34:39.780,1:34:44.100
But that also wouldn’t last, thanks to a 
brand new development in goomba engineering:

1:34:44.100,1:34:48.480
the goomba ladder. This is essentially 
like a goomba bridge, except this time,

1:34:48.480,1:34:54.420
the bounces are mostly vertical instead. This let 
him bypass the pole entirely, at the cost of many,

1:34:54.420,1:35:00.540
many clones. Long story short, this process 
took him 46 goomba clones. One interesting

1:35:00.540,1:35:04.560
detail to consider is how Pannen managed to 
clone from this bob-omb in the first place.

1:35:04.560,1:35:08.100
Vacant object slot manipulation 
is something that I’ve avoided

1:35:08.100,1:35:12.180
talking about in detail because while it is a 
crucial element of anything involving cloning,

1:35:12.180,1:35:16.320
one doesn’t need to know all of its intricacies 
in detail to appreciate the incredible work

1:35:16.320,1:35:20.700
that goes behind these cloning strategies. 
Here, though, I wanted to give a glimpse

1:35:20.700,1:35:24.420
of the kind of effort that sometimes has 
to be made just to start cloning objects.

1:35:24.420,1:35:29.460
The main sources for all of these clones are this 
bob-omb and that goomba trio. If you remember, on

1:35:29.460,1:35:33.720
a flat surface like this, it’s extremely 
difficult to clone with a bob-omb. The

1:35:33.720,1:35:37.860
only real option Pannenkoek had was 
to hold it off the edge as it blew up.

1:35:37.860,1:35:41.340
Grabbing it this way will give Mario 
the vacant object slot number 9,

1:35:41.340,1:35:45.000
because of all the smoke particles and 
the explosion happening at the same time.

1:35:45.000,1:35:49.140
Now, because a goomba trio is made up 
of three goombas, they will load into

1:35:49.140,1:35:54.840
the first 3 vacant slots. This is a problem. 
To get a goomba to show up in Mario’s hands,

1:35:54.840,1:35:59.160
Pannen needs to lower that vacant object 
slot number from 9 to between 1 and 3,

1:35:59.160,1:36:03.300
which means he has to load at least 9 temporary 
objects that would unload in a different order,

1:36:03.300,1:36:08.100
giving him a new vacant slot number. The 
best he could do by kicking up dust was only

1:36:08.100,1:36:12.480
up to 8 dust particles, so he paired it with 
collecting the bob-omb’s coin to add sparkles

1:36:12.480,1:36:17.520
to the object count. So, a temporary particle 
loaded into Mario’s hands and then unloaded,

1:36:17.520,1:36:21.540
which lowered his vacant slot number enough 
that he was able to clone a goomba from there.

1:36:21.540,1:36:27.060
But because the coin from a bob-omb is a one 
time thing, this method could not be reused. So,

1:36:27.060,1:36:32.100
he used that first goomba clone to get easier 
future cloning. Bob-ombs immediately explode

1:36:32.100,1:36:35.640
when they come in contact with other 
bob-ombs, goombas or other enemies.

1:36:35.640,1:36:40.140
With the goomba clone just off the edge like 
this, when the bob-omb runs off the edge,

1:36:40.140,1:36:44.280
it falls on the goomba and instantly 
explodes. Mario is then able to grab an

1:36:44.280,1:36:49.380
unloaded bob-omb in vacant slot 2 instead of 
9. From there, cloning more goombas is easy.

1:36:49.380,1:36:54.420
Alright, that was pretty crazy, but there 
was one more major problem. Pannen needed

1:36:54.420,1:36:58.380
46 clones to get past the pole here, four 
more clones to get the red coin here,

1:36:58.380,1:37:03.480
two to get the final red coin, and 61 more 
clones to bounce into the pipe. The game was

1:37:03.480,1:37:09.120
never going to handle this many goomba clones at 
once. The solution for that was twofold. First,

1:37:09.120,1:37:13.380
the disjointed axle hitbox let him skip one 
step of the upper goomba bridge, and second,

1:37:13.380,1:37:17.040
he found that he could bring a bob-omb to 
the pipe and skip the last few steps of

1:37:17.040,1:37:22.440
the goomba bridge. This brought down the 
total amount of goombas from 113 to 63.

1:37:22.440,1:37:25.860
Nonetheless, because most of these 
goombas were close together over there,

1:37:25.860,1:37:29.760
the additional clones Pannen needed to get 
this red coin would invariably crash the

1:37:29.760,1:37:34.740
game. How he solved that seems absolutely 
insane, because it is absolutely insane:

1:37:34.740,1:37:37.740
he got up the entire course, 
without getting any red coins,

1:37:37.740,1:37:42.240
entered the Bowser fight, and then, he 
purposely fell off to his death. But why?

1:37:42.840,1:37:46.020
Because this puts Mario back here, 
at the very top of the stage,

1:37:46.020,1:37:50.460
but it resets the entire level so that 
all the clones are now gone. From there,

1:37:50.460,1:37:55.260
he was able to set up all the clones again. But 
this time, because he started from above, he only

1:37:55.260,1:38:00.120
needed a few clones to get back up the pole once, 
instead of using 46 to build a goomba ladder to

1:38:00.120,1:38:04.740
bypass it. And that made all the difference 
to enable this crazy A press save to happen.

1:38:04.740,1:38:10.680
But wait! There’s more! Three days later, 
Pannenkoek figured out a way to save the very last

1:38:10.680,1:38:16.560
A press past the beginning platforms. He did it 
by carrying Chuckya all the way there. In short,

1:38:16.560,1:38:20.700
the two main challenges were getting past 
this gap, and getting from holding Chuckya

1:38:20.700,1:38:23.880
here to having it throw Mario into the 
coin without killing it in the process.

1:38:23.880,1:38:29.340
Both of these were solved by dive grinding. 
Basically, that gives Mario enough speed in

1:38:29.340,1:38:33.360
a short enough time that he has time to catch 
up to Chuckya and get caught before it lands,

1:38:33.360,1:38:37.440
similarly to what he had done in Wet-Dry 
World before. And with that improvement,

1:38:37.440,1:38:42.540
what was once a 13 A press stage was now 
down to only two, both at the very beginning.

1:38:43.920,1:38:53.760
After this crazy adventure, Pannenkoek’s ideas 
dried up a bit. College had started again, and

1:38:53.760,1:38:59.100
he stepped away from the A Button Challenge for a 
while. But in the meantime, someone posted a very

1:38:59.100,1:39:04.860
bold claim on the Castle Movement A presses video. 
“I figured out how to go to Hazy Maze Cave without

1:39:04.860,1:39:10.980
pressing the A button once!” Naturally, Pannen was 
skeptical. What are the chances that some random

1:39:10.980,1:39:16.020
YouTube commenter had genuinely found a way to 
improve upon one of the most basic A presses in

1:39:16.020,1:39:21.240
the entire challenge? After all, he’d been getting 
dozens of these empty claims for well over a year

1:39:21.240,1:39:26.640
now. Well, obviously, if I’m talking about it, you 
already know the answer. And Pannenkoek would soon

1:39:26.640,1:39:33.660
find out as well. The probability is zero. Because 
this is no random YouTube commenter. This is Tyler

1:39:33.660,1:39:39.900
Kehne. The great mind behind the discovery of 
parallel universes. Showing up out of the blue

1:39:39.900,1:39:44.460
one day, he annihilated every expectation and 
took the A Button Challenge to the next level.

1:39:48.840,1:39:53.700
While everybody was focused on the 120-star A 
Button Challenge, Tyler Kehne actually had a

1:39:53.700,1:39:58.500
different outlook: his primary goal was to make 
it possible to beat the game in 0 A presses,

1:39:58.500,1:40:03.960
no matter the star count. Now, Super Mario 
64 is very famous for its 0-star speedrun,

1:40:03.960,1:40:08.760
but there’s a bit of a problem with it. Most 
of the star door skips require speed-generating

1:40:08.760,1:40:13.320
techniques that make heavy use of the A button, 
like Backwards Long Jumping, or Hyperspeed Wall

1:40:13.320,1:40:19.440
Kicking. A 0-star, or even a 16-star run, would 
automatically incur at least a dozen A presses

1:40:19.440,1:40:24.780
to skip the 50 and 70 star doors. So, the only 
reasonable method would be to find 70 different

1:40:24.780,1:40:30.000
stars that could be collected in 0 A presses, and 
beat all three Bowser stages without the A button.

1:40:30.000,1:40:35.940
When he first looked at it, Tyler found that 
the lowest possible count was 9 A presses. Those

1:40:35.940,1:40:40.680
included two A presses to beat Bowser in the Dark 
World, a half A press for Board Bowser’s Sub in

1:40:40.680,1:40:45.960
Dire Dire Docks, as well as five other stars, one 
in Bowser in the Fire Sea, one to reach Bowser in

1:40:45.960,1:40:51.480
the Sky, two within Bowser in the Sky, and because 
only 65 stars were attainable in 0 A presses,

1:40:51.480,1:40:56.580
three additional A presses to get the required 
70 stars. The half A press is important here

1:40:56.580,1:41:00.240
because in the event that the A presses 
to reach 70 stars and to beat Bowser in

1:41:00.240,1:41:04.380
the Dark World were all saved, there would no 
longer be a prior A press to leech off from.

1:41:04.380,1:41:06.000
So, from this starting point,

1:41:06.000,1:41:09.960
Tyler made it his mission to lower that 
A press count all the way down to 0.

1:41:09.960,1:41:14.220
His first discovery in that direction was a 
huge breakthrough, because it allowed him to

1:41:14.220,1:41:18.120
go to Hazy Maze Cave in 0 A presses, 
unlocking a whole level that already

1:41:18.120,1:41:23.280
had three stars at 0 A presses. Because 
Pannenkoek was busy with college finals,

1:41:23.280,1:41:27.840
Tyler took it upon himself to make a 
video about it. The crucial development

1:41:27.840,1:41:33.180
is the Star dance clip, which is made possible 
thanks to Mario’s ability to grab onto ledges.

1:41:33.180,1:41:37.500
During most kinds of jumps or in freefall, 
Mario can grab onto a ledge that he doesn’t

1:41:37.500,1:41:42.480
quite have enough height to land on. This 
allows him to reach a floor up to 150

1:41:42.480,1:41:47.880
units higher than his own position, up from 30 
with a direct landing. A regular dive recover

1:41:47.880,1:41:52.020
doesn’t allow Mario to grab onto ledges, 
no matter how high, because that specific

1:41:52.020,1:41:56.340
action type prevents Mario from grabbing 
the ledge. But when Mario collects a star,

1:41:56.340,1:42:00.780
this unique falling action type called the 
star fall does allow him to grab a ledge.

1:42:00.780,1:42:04.740
Normally, during a ledge grab, Mario is 
technically on top of the ledge while his

1:42:04.740,1:42:08.760
visual model hangs off. This is the 
key mechanic that makes cannonless

1:42:08.760,1:42:13.440
possible. In this case, because the star 
dance overrides the ledge grab animation,

1:42:13.440,1:42:16.620
Mario instantly pops up onto the 
higher ledge and starts dancing.

1:42:16.620,1:42:21.600
The star dance clip was revolutionary, in 
that it allowed Mario to reach a ledge as

1:42:21.600,1:42:27.000
high as about 280 units, up from the 158 
that a simple dive recover can achieve.

1:42:27.000,1:42:31.500
There was only one simple problem: 
it required a star. Not only that,

1:42:31.500,1:42:36.540
but a star in a very specific location. 
This was a major hurdle for two reasons.

1:42:36.540,1:42:41.040
First, no stars are by default located 
somewhere that they can be useful to reach

1:42:41.040,1:42:45.240
a higher ledge. But most importantly, 
in any one of the 15 main courses,

1:42:45.240,1:42:49.260
collecting a star will automatically 
exit the stage. But there is one

1:42:49.260,1:42:54.240
exception that conveniently sidesteps both 
of these key problems: the 100-coin star.

1:42:54.240,1:43:00.060
This star appears precisely 245 units 
above where the 100th coin was collected,

1:43:00.060,1:43:04.680
so its location can be pretty much anywhere 
that a coin can be collected at. But also,

1:43:04.680,1:43:08.040
other than some castle secret stars, 
this is the only type of star that

1:43:08.040,1:43:12.180
keeps Mario in the level after collecting 
it. Therefore, with clever manipulation,

1:43:12.180,1:43:16.560
the 100th coin could be collected just beneath 
a high ledge, and the star fall action could

1:43:16.560,1:43:20.820
make Mario grab the ledge and save an A press. 
And then, because this is the 100-coin star,

1:43:20.820,1:43:25.680
he would be able to stay in the level afterwards. 
This is the magic of the Star Dance Clip.

1:43:25.680,1:43:31.080
Tyler immediately used it in Stand Tall on 
Four Pillars. A goomba knockback bounce into

1:43:31.080,1:43:35.400
the star is just enough to pop Mario up on the 
grate, which has a warp that takes him further

1:43:35.400,1:43:39.660
up the pyramid. This is now high enough to 
reach the miniboss fight without using A.

1:43:39.660,1:43:44.100
A month later, still on his own, 
Tyler Kehne discovered a massive

1:43:44.100,1:43:46.680
new technique that he named the 207 Dive Recover.

1:43:46.680,1:43:53.100
A regular dive recover can get Mario on platforms 
up to 158 units higher, but this special trick

1:43:53.100,1:43:59.220
gets him up to 207 units higher. This is made 
possible because of the wall and floor hitboxes.

1:44:00.300,1:44:05.160
If you remember, I said before that wall hitboxes 
extend up to 30 units below the top of the wall.

1:44:05.160,1:44:11.880
A dive recover gives Mario 128 units of height, 
so on a platform that is up to 158 units higher,

1:44:11.880,1:44:16.020
Mario can dive recover just above the 
wall hitbox and onto the platform. If

1:44:16.020,1:44:19.500
the platform is any higher, the wall will 
prevent Mario from reaching the floor.

1:44:19.500,1:44:24.900
The floor hitbox, however, extends 78 
units under the floor. If Mario finds

1:44:24.900,1:44:28.920
himself somewhere in this region, he’ll 
snap up onto the floor. Theoretically,

1:44:28.920,1:44:33.300
Mario could dive recover into the bottom of this 
region and snap up to the floor, gaining up to,

1:44:33.300,1:44:38.580
but not including, 207 units of height. In 
practice though, a platform is almost always

1:44:38.580,1:44:43.080
surrounded by walls that prevent Mario from 
reaching this zone. But what if that wasn’t

1:44:43.080,1:44:48.600
always the case? This is the key discovery 
behind this new technique: misalignments.

1:44:48.600,1:44:55.020
Super Mario 64 tracks Mario’s position using 
32-bit floating point numbers. So, Mario’s

1:44:55.020,1:45:00.240
position on each axis can be virtually anything, 
including 8 million numbers just between 1 and 2

1:45:00.240,1:45:05.700
alone. The game physics calculation that checks 
the height of the floor Mario is on or above has

1:45:05.700,1:45:10.500
a built-in shortcut. Instead of using the 32-bit 
floating point number for Mario’s position,

1:45:10.500,1:45:15.840
the programmers decided to convert it into 
a 16-bit integer. This lost some precision,

1:45:15.840,1:45:20.040
sure, because any fraction would be rounded 
down to a whole number, but because one unit

1:45:20.040,1:45:24.120
is such a small distance, a fraction of 
a unit would be completely insignificant.

1:45:24.120,1:45:28.080
Well, it turns out that it’s not that 
insignificant when the wall collision

1:45:28.080,1:45:33.420
check does not make the same shortcut. This 
leads to a very specific, literal corner case

1:45:33.420,1:45:37.740
scenario where Mario can be on a floor but 
beyond its bounding walls at the same time.

1:45:38.340,1:45:43.380
This 1 by 1 unit square is beyond each of 
the wall hitboxes, but if Mario ends up here,

1:45:43.380,1:45:48.000
his position will be rounded down for floor 
calculations, putting him on the floor. So,

1:45:48.000,1:45:52.320
for all practical purposes, in the direction 
away from the origin, floors extend 1 unit

1:45:52.320,1:45:56.760
further than their associated walls, leaving 
a tiny exposed square at the outside corners.

1:45:56.760,1:46:00.960
This means that any platform which has 
a corner pointing away from the origin

1:46:00.960,1:46:05.040
in both axes has a 1x1 misalignment 
that can be used to bypass the wall

1:46:05.040,1:46:10.020
hitbox and snap up onto the floor from 78 
units below it instead of the usual 30.

1:46:10.020,1:46:13.800
It seems rather small, but there are 
actually numerous instances where

1:46:13.800,1:46:17.820
that makes all the difference. First, 
these platforms in Bowser in the Sky,

1:46:17.820,1:46:21.480
where Tyler discovered the trick in 
the first place. As it turns out,

1:46:21.480,1:46:25.560
all of these gaps that were just out of reach 
with a regular dive recover were now reachable

1:46:25.560,1:46:30.600
using misalignments! All of them, except 
the last one, unfortunately. But he was

1:46:30.600,1:46:35.880
undeterred. He was determined to make Bowser 
in the Sky fully completable in 0 A presses.

1:46:35.880,1:46:40.680
Despite his already impressive track record 
of two major discoveries in a month, nothing

1:46:40.680,1:46:45.600
would truly showcase Tyler Kehne’s creativity 
and mastery of the game like the Chuckya drop.

1:46:49.920,1:46:55.140
From all the way down here, Mario is just on the 
edge of Chuckya’s activation radius. When Chuckya

1:46:55.140,1:47:00.480
is deactivated, it stops moving and isn’t being 
rendered, but it is still loaded. But there’s one

1:47:00.480,1:47:05.880
crucial function that still works: turning towards 
Mario. Chuckya has two main behaviour modes:

1:47:05.880,1:47:10.140
chasing and turning. In chase mode, it 
charges forwards until Mario is behind

1:47:10.140,1:47:15.120
it. This is what the white line demarcates. 
Then, it stops for about a second and a half,

1:47:15.120,1:47:19.980
and goes into turning mode. In turning mode, 
it turns until Mario is in the yellow cone,

1:47:19.980,1:47:24.840
then starts chasing again. If Mario quickly 
goes from behind to in front of Chuckya,

1:47:24.840,1:47:28.680
he can already be in the yellow cone when 
Chuckya starts turning. In that case,

1:47:28.680,1:47:32.460
it turns by about 5 and a half degrees 
or until it faces Mario directly before

1:47:32.460,1:47:37.320
it starts chasing. This is important because 
of the geometry of the platform Chuckya is on.

1:47:37.320,1:47:42.720
Chuckya has a built in mechanism that prevents 
it from running off a ledge. If its next intended

1:47:42.720,1:47:46.500
position is more than 50 units above the 
floor, that means it’s about to fall off,

1:47:46.500,1:47:51.060
so it will stop on the edge of the platform. 
This check is only made if Chuckya is

1:47:51.060,1:47:56.160
currently on the ground. If it’s already 
airborne, this no longer matters. But how

1:47:56.160,1:48:01.200
can Chuckya be airborne if it can’t fall 
off in the first place? Because of slopes!

1:48:01.200,1:48:06.240
Chuckya has a constant gravity of 4 units 
per frame squared, the same as Mario. On

1:48:06.240,1:48:10.920
any given frame, if, after falling down by 4 
units, Chuckya is on or just below a floor,

1:48:10.920,1:48:14.520
it bounces. If it’s still in the floor, 
then it’s popped back up on the ground,

1:48:14.520,1:48:19.680
but if it isn’t, it becomes airborne. So, if 
Chuckya moves onto a floor that is between 2.7

1:48:19.680,1:48:24.060
and 50 units lower than its current height, it 
will become airborne, and once it’s airborne,

1:48:24.060,1:48:28.140
the 50 unit limit no longer applies, so 
it can now fall off from much higher.

1:48:28.140,1:48:33.840
There’s one last potential hurdle: Chuckya 
can’t just run around entire levels. It

1:48:33.840,1:48:37.320
has a point called its home, and it can 
only chase Mario up to a certain distance

1:48:37.320,1:48:41.340
away from that home. But thankfully, 
the distance is strictly horizontal,

1:48:41.340,1:48:46.440
and by a stroke of pure luck, it happens to be 
just big enough to allow this strategy to work.

1:48:46.440,1:48:52.440
Every piece of the puzzle can now fall into 
place. Mario performs a complex mating dance

1:48:52.440,1:48:57.360
down at the bottom, on the edge of Chuckya’s 
activation radius. He makes Chuckya turn to

1:48:57.360,1:49:01.920
face him here, then moves back behind it to 
activate the stopping period. In that time,

1:49:01.920,1:49:05.460
he quickly goes back within the yellow cone 
to have Chuckya turn just a little more

1:49:05.460,1:49:11.100
counter-clockwise. He repeats this until Chuckya 
faces in this direction as much as possible. Then,

1:49:11.100,1:49:15.360
he activates Chuckya by entering the radius, and 
makes it run up against the edge and onto the

1:49:15.360,1:49:20.340
sloped ground here. At this point, he can only 
activate Chuckya with dive recovers and ground

1:49:20.340,1:49:25.020
pounds. Once Chuckya runs onto the slope, 
it becomes airborne and can now fall off,

1:49:25.020,1:49:29.760
but it’s headed in the wrong direction. So 
Mario falls back out of the activation radius,

1:49:29.760,1:49:34.560
freezing Chuckya in midair. Then, he moves 
back behind it to make it turn towards him,

1:49:34.560,1:49:40.080
and reactivates it so it now falls down towards 
him. Again, he moves back behind it to make it

1:49:40.080,1:49:44.700
stop before it falls off the course altogether. 
And from there, he’s able to be grabbed and

1:49:44.700,1:49:50.100
chucked on the upper platform, and the final A 
press in Bowser in the Sky had finally been saved.

1:49:50.100,1:49:56.100
It’s impossible to overstate how unlikely this 
strategy really is. Every aspect of it just

1:49:56.100,1:50:01.140
barely works. This wall allows Chuckya to run up 
against it instead of getting stuck on the edge,

1:50:01.140,1:50:05.820
at precisely the right angle to allow Chuckya to 
reach all the way to the slope while Mario is down

1:50:05.820,1:50:10.800
below. The slope is just steep enough to cause 
Chuckya to become airborne, the perfect placement

1:50:10.800,1:50:15.420
of the edge of the activation radius allows 
for activating and deactivating it on command,

1:50:15.420,1:50:19.500
and the perfect size of the area around its 
home allows it to move all the way to this

1:50:19.500,1:50:24.360
point. It’s even crazier when you consider 
that Tyler was working with very rudimentary

1:50:24.360,1:50:28.920
tools and little understanding of all the 
mechanics I just described. The fact that

1:50:28.920,1:50:33.060
this A press save is possible at all is nothing 
short of a miracle, but the fact that it was

1:50:33.060,1:50:38.820
discovered over 7 years ago is indescribably 
unlikely. You just can’t make that story up.

1:50:41.220,1:50:48.120
Again in October, and again on his own, Tyler 
Kehne found yet another groundbreaking trick

1:50:48.120,1:50:53.520
to gain precious height in specific scenarios: 
vertical speed conservation, or VSC for short.

1:50:54.120,1:50:57.840
Mario’s vertical speed is a variable 
that’s almost entirely independent

1:50:57.840,1:51:02.520
from his horizontal speed. This is mostly 
a major hurdle for the A Button Challenge,

1:51:02.520,1:51:07.200
but it can sometimes be useful. In certain 
circumstances, when Mario lands on the ground,

1:51:07.200,1:51:12.120
his vertical speed isn’t automatically set to 
0. It remains what it was at the last moment

1:51:12.120,1:51:16.860
where Mario was in the air. This means that if 
Mario was somehow able to land on a platform

1:51:16.860,1:51:21.540
while he’s moving up, he could get off of it later 
and retain his upwards speed, potentially gaining

1:51:21.540,1:51:26.640
more height than ever possible before. There are 
two reasons why this can’t work, though. First,

1:51:26.640,1:51:31.620
Mario can’t really land on anything if he’s 
moving up, and second, vertical speed is reset

1:51:31.620,1:51:37.320
to 0 as soon as Mario starts moving. But what if I 
told you that Mario doesn’t need to move to move?

1:51:37.920,1:51:41.400
The action of throwing a punch makes 
Mario inch forward a little bit,

1:51:41.400,1:51:47.100
but it doesn’t require moving the control stick. 
It also doesn’t reset the vertical speed. So,

1:51:47.100,1:51:51.120
if Mario lands with a non-zero vertical 
speed, then punches repeatedly until he

1:51:51.120,1:51:53.820
falls off from the platform he’s 
on, he will conserve that speed.

1:51:53.820,1:51:57.420
But this doesn’t fix the problem that 
Mario needs to fall onto something,

1:51:57.420,1:52:02.520
therefore have negative vertical speed, in order 
to actually land on it. Well, it turns out this

1:52:02.520,1:52:07.440
isn’t strictly true. There are some cases where 
it’s possible to move up onto a platform, but

1:52:07.440,1:52:12.180
they’re relatively rare. For example, a platform 
that doesn’t have any walls, like a magic carpet,

1:52:12.180,1:52:17.940
can work. Also, if the platform itself is moving 
up, like an elevator, it can move onto Mario. So,

1:52:17.940,1:52:21.300
it is indeed possible to land on a 
platform with positive vertical speed,

1:52:21.300,1:52:25.140
and there are some very specific cases where 
this trick could actually come in handy.

1:52:25.920,1:52:30.540
At the end of October, Pannenkoek finally had 
enough time to come back to the challenge and

1:52:30.540,1:52:35.760
he was immediately met with this revolutionary 
work. He instantly recognized Tyler Kehne’s

1:52:35.760,1:52:40.140
potential and invited him on the ABC crew, but 
he also saw the potential of these three new

1:52:40.140,1:52:45.420
key discoveries. The floodgates were officially 
open and improvements could start flowing again.

1:52:45.420,1:52:50.400
First came The Big House in the Sky, where 
a dive recover onto the magic carpet allowed

1:52:50.400,1:52:54.540
Pannenkoek to conserve its vertical speed. 
Then, by getting pushed off the carpet,

1:52:54.540,1:52:59.640
Mario enters freefall, but gains height like a 
dive recover. Being in freefall means that he

1:52:59.640,1:53:03.540
can ledge grab, allowing him to get onto 
these blocks without an A press. Sadly,

1:53:03.540,1:53:07.560
the last one is higher than the others, and 
one A press was therefore still required.

1:53:07.560,1:53:12.600
Next up was Big Boo’s Haunt, where this A press 
was proving problematic for the four stars that

1:53:12.600,1:53:17.640
required going up to the second floor. Again 
with VSC, but this time done using the stairs

1:53:17.640,1:53:22.860
raising onto Mario, Pannen was able to cut this 
A press out, saving four at once. The red coin

1:53:22.860,1:53:26.760
star also required getting rid of that half 
A press for kicking onto boos in this room,

1:53:26.760,1:53:29.880
but Pannen was able to figure it 
out using a dive recover instead.

1:53:29.880,1:53:34.320
Then, in Dire Dire Docks, he found that 
these cork boxes can be climbed on using

1:53:34.320,1:53:39.840
misalignments. This allowed him to reach this high 
platform in 0 A presses and without a pole clone,

1:53:39.840,1:53:44.580
which, again, revolutionized 4 different 
stars. Board Bowser’s Sub was now down to

1:53:44.580,1:53:49.560
0 A presses. Both Through the Jet Stream 
and Collect the Caps were also down to 0 A

1:53:49.560,1:53:53.640
presses because the special caps could now 
be obtained without jumping. And finally,

1:53:53.640,1:53:58.200
Pole-Jumping for Red Coins could get rid of the 
initial half A press and go down to a clean 2.

1:53:58.920,1:54:02.940
In Bowser in the Dark World, three 
TASers, Tyler, Pannen and Plush,

1:54:02.940,1:54:07.200
and two new techniques combined to 
save the remaining two A presses. Here,

1:54:07.200,1:54:11.340
Mario does a dive recover into the crystal, 
which is made up of tiny walls in an interesting

1:54:11.340,1:54:16.140
arrangement. By entering two wall hitboxes at 
once, Mario gets pushed all the way to here.

1:54:16.140,1:54:21.000
Because the floor slopes up, this is enough 
to land immediately after the dive recover,

1:54:21.000,1:54:25.260
allowing him to preserve the vertical speed 
all the way to here with repeated punches.

1:54:25.260,1:54:30.060
The A press to enter the pipe was solved 
using a misalignment. Specifically,

1:54:30.060,1:54:33.720
this corner points outwards from the 
origin, so Tyler Kehne was able to

1:54:33.720,1:54:37.380
dive recover into the misalignment and 
save the final A press in this stage.

1:54:37.380,1:54:43.080
Now in Rainbow Ride, Pannenkoek found another 
multi-purpose A press save. This time, it was

1:54:43.080,1:54:47.880
to reach the cruiser at the top of the stage. 
He used vertical speed conservation, combined

1:54:47.880,1:54:53.640
with a very precise, complex Lakitu lure to get 
it to fly up precisely into that corner. The VSC

1:54:53.640,1:54:58.260
was achieved by making this block start falling, 
then dive recovering, and landing one frame later

1:54:58.260,1:55:02.820
on this block. Mario doesn’t dip low enough to 
start being affected by the walls of that block,

1:55:02.820,1:55:07.800
making this maneuver possible. Then, one punch 
gets him off the platform with vertical speed,

1:55:07.800,1:55:12.960
and the Lakitu bounce gets him just high enough to 
grab this ledge. This brought Cruiser Crossing the

1:55:12.960,1:55:17.520
Rainbow to 0 A presses, and Somewhere Over the 
Rainbow down to 1 because of the cannon shot.

1:55:18.180,1:55:22.860
With the 120-star A press count down 
to 71, Pannenkoek and the ABC crew,

1:55:22.860,1:55:28.260
including three more people, Kaze Emanuar of 
romhacking fame, Ryan Strobach, and Pedro Viktor,

1:55:28.260,1:55:32.880
decided to make a prediction: how low would 
the A press count be 6 months into the future,

1:55:32.880,1:55:40.260
on May 13th, 2015? Everyone made guesses roughly 
around 60. Tyler Kehne was the most optimistic

1:55:40.260,1:55:45.120
of them all with 54, predicting that 17 A 
presses would be cut down before 6 months

1:55:45.120,1:55:49.920
had passed. Needless to say, every single one of 
these predictions would turn out way off base.

1:55:50.940,1:55:55.680
Meanwhile, Tyler Kehne, who was more focused 
on Any%, tried to get rid of the A press to

1:55:55.680,1:56:00.360
enter Bowser in the Sky. He found that on the 
Rainbow Ride side of the room, he was able to

1:56:00.360,1:56:05.160
use misalignments to ascend some of the steps, 
but two of them were being difficult. This one,

1:56:05.160,1:56:09.720
and the final step. The ramp on the top step 
complicated things a bit, but using a ground

1:56:09.720,1:56:14.760
pound and some slide grinding, Tyler was able 
to make it up. The first step’s problem is that

1:56:14.760,1:56:19.140
it doesn’t line up right for a misalignment 
to exist. Tyler could have used a slidekick

1:56:19.140,1:56:23.400
bounce from Rainbow Ride, but because he was 
concerned with Any%, where Rainbow Ride was not

1:56:23.400,1:56:28.380
gonna be entered, he had to find another 
method. He found the glitchy ledge grab.

1:56:28.380,1:56:33.540
When Mario hits a wall, a check is made to see 
if he can grab the ledge. In short, the game

1:56:33.540,1:56:38.820
checks for a wall hitbox at two points: 30 units 
above Mario’s position, and 150 units above,

1:56:38.820,1:56:42.900
which is about the size of Mario’s model. 
If it finds a wall hitbox at this point,

1:56:42.900,1:56:48.540
but not the other, it will try to find a ledge to 
grab onto by looking for a floor hitbox from 160

1:56:48.540,1:56:53.820
units to 100 units above Mario’s position. 
Because floor hitboxes are 78 units high,

1:56:53.820,1:56:58.380
this means that Mario can theoretically 
grab a ledge up to 238 units above his

1:56:58.380,1:57:01.800
position. But if there is a ledge 
that high, wouldn’t there be a wall

1:57:01.800,1:57:06.780
below that ledge that the wall check would 
detect? Yes, but not always. Here’s why.

1:57:07.380,1:57:11.940
Wall hitboxes are 50 units wide perpendicularly 
to the wall, but at the edge of the wall,

1:57:11.940,1:57:16.980
they don’t necessarily extend perpendicularly. 
They actually extend along the closest axis,

1:57:16.980,1:57:21.960
either X or Z. So, if a wall isn’t aligned 
exactly along one of the axes, its hitbox

1:57:21.960,1:57:27.240
will have a slanted shape along its edges. In 
this corner, both walls extend along the X axis,

1:57:27.240,1:57:32.160
creating this shape. When Mario is in this 
zone, he’s in the low wall hitbox, but not the

1:57:32.160,1:57:38.400
high one. So, the game detects a wall 30 units 
above Mario, but not 150 above him. Therefore,

1:57:38.400,1:57:43.560
the floor check is triggered. Now, because Mario 
is colliding with the low wall, the game uses the

1:57:43.560,1:57:48.240
line perpendicular to that wall to check for a 
floor. Because of the lower wall’s orientation,

1:57:48.240,1:57:52.320
the perpendicular line is angled towards 
the higher floor, so the floor check finds

1:57:52.320,1:57:57.360
that one and Mario grabs the higher ledge. If 
the walls extended perpendicularly instead of

1:57:57.360,1:58:02.280
along the closest axis, this would not have been 
possible. Also, there was finally only a single

1:58:02.280,1:58:07.080
A press absolutely required to beat the game, 
to jump off the pole in Bowser in the Fire Sea.

1:58:08.340,1:58:13.740
In these frantic two weeks, vertical speed 
conservation had proven to be a key asset to

1:58:13.740,1:58:18.120
gain height by preserving positive vertical 
momentum. But what about negative vertical

1:58:18.120,1:58:22.680
momentum? Well, yes, negative vertical 
speed can be preserved, but obviously,

1:58:22.680,1:58:27.660
in a challenge where height is precious, falling 
even faster than usual is crazy to even consider.

1:58:27.660,1:58:34.080
But the closest thing to crazy is genius. Plush 
figured out that for Express Elevator - Hurry Up!,

1:58:34.080,1:58:38.580
he could conserve negative vertical speed to 
fall down faster after activating the elevator,

1:58:38.580,1:58:41.880
making it possible to reach the 
platform using only B swimming,

1:58:41.880,1:58:44.280
and cutting the half A press 
that was left in this star.

1:58:44.280,1:58:49.380
Plush was a relatively rare contributor, but 
this time, he came up with another A press save

1:58:49.380,1:58:54.180
in the same month, in Jolly Roger Bay. Through 
the Jet Stream’s A press to jump into the star

1:58:54.180,1:58:58.140
could be skipped by positioning Mario in the 
center of the jet stream so that it would push

1:58:58.140,1:59:02.940
Mario up into the star once the metal cap 
expired. This seems obvious in hindsight,

1:59:02.940,1:59:06.840
but it’s actually extremely precise, to the 
point where it had been tried before and

1:59:06.840,1:59:12.300
discarded. The stream pushes Mario up, but also 
outwards, so he has to stand on the exact center,

1:59:12.300,1:59:15.720
give or take a tiny fraction of a 
unit, in order to not miss the star.

1:59:15.720,1:59:21.840
Plush was on a hot streak. He struck again, 
this time in Dire Dire Docks. He found that

1:59:21.840,1:59:25.860
the underwater shell’s higher speed could 
be partially preserved with frame perfect

1:59:25.860,1:59:31.080
B swimming. Normally, B swimming has a speed 
cap of 7 units per frame, but with this method,

1:59:31.080,1:59:36.000
it could hold a speed of 16 units per frame. 
This is enough to do Chests in the Current

1:59:36.000,1:59:40.200
without being sucked into the whirlpool, so 
another half A press was taken out of the game.

1:59:40.980,1:59:47.220
The next improvement came a whole month 
later, at the very end of 2014. Pannenkoek,

1:59:47.220,1:59:50.700
not to be outdone, was still busy 
concocting absurd routes that no one

1:59:50.700,1:59:54.660
else could have even remotely considered. 
And this time, it was one of his best.

1:59:56.880,2:00:00.000
Swingin’ in the Breeze in 
0 A presses, down from 1.

2:00:00.000,2:00:04.620
The key new glitch in this route 
was hands free teleport. Usually,

2:00:04.620,2:00:09.660
when Mario is holding an object, he cannot use a 
warp. But when he’s holding an object hands free,

2:00:09.660,2:00:13.440
he can. The result is that the 
original object remains in limbo,

2:00:13.440,2:00:18.360
but the held object is discarded. This means 
the original object cannot be retrieved from

2:00:18.360,2:00:23.400
limbo and is stuck there forever. But of 
course, there’s one exception: bob-ombs.

2:00:23.400,2:00:27.420
After a hands free teleport with a bob-omb, 
Mario will no longer be holding anything,

2:00:27.420,2:00:32.040
which gives him back his wide range of actions, 
but he’ll still have the original bob-omb hovering

2:00:32.040,2:00:37.260
in front of him at all times, invisible but still 
tangible. He can recover that bob-omb by grabbing

2:00:37.260,2:00:41.880
it straight out of limbo. Now, what happens 
if that bob-omb is also in a bloated state?

2:00:41.880,2:00:45.660
Well, because it’s larger than 
usual, it pushes Mario backwards,

2:00:45.660,2:00:50.460
again by a varying amount depending on the 
exact frame it was grabbed on. And this is

2:00:50.460,2:00:55.500
the reason behind the behaviour that Pannenkoek 
exploits in this star. Let’s go through the route.

2:00:55.500,2:01:01.980
First, he goes up to the cruiser using VSC and 
the Lakitu bounce, like in the other stars. Once

2:01:01.980,2:01:06.960
there, he grabs a bloated bob-omb hands free by 
being pushed off the edge as he grabs it. Then,

2:01:06.960,2:01:11.160
he carefully navigates to the top of the red 
coin maze while preserving the hands free

2:01:11.160,2:01:15.480
state. In order to reach the warp while 
hands free holding a bloated bob-omb, he

2:01:15.480,2:01:19.500
needs it to be bloated enough to give him 
a large push. But after taking the warp,

2:01:19.500,2:01:23.760
the large push becomes a little cumbersome, 
so he regrabs the bob-omb and uses this thin

2:01:23.760,2:01:27.720
ledge to get hands free holding again, but 
this time, with a smaller bloated bob-omb.

2:01:27.720,2:01:33.360
Back onto the maze, he now has a bob-omb that 
gives him a slight backwards push. He makes his

2:01:33.360,2:01:38.220
way to here, where he lures the Fly Guy up and 
bounces onto it to twirl over to this platform.

2:01:38.220,2:01:43.500
Then, he pushes the goomba up the slope using 
the hitbox of the invisible bloated bob-omb in

2:01:43.500,2:01:47.700
front of him. But because the bob-omb pushes 
Mario backwards, he can’t get enough forward

2:01:47.700,2:01:52.260
momentum to climb the slippery slope. 
But that’s no problem for Pannenkoek,

2:01:52.260,2:02:02.280
because this is what he does instead. From there, 
he can push the goomba all the way to the star,

2:02:02.280,2:02:07.200
get rid of the bob-omb, and use a damage knockback 
bounce to reach the star and save an A press.

2:02:08.040,2:02:14.880
The year was now 2015. Pannenkoek went back to 
Pole Jumping for Red Coins. The new misalignment

2:02:14.880,2:02:18.780
allowed him to reach the cap box, and using 
the surrounding walls, perform the hat in

2:02:18.780,2:02:24.180
hand glitch. This in turn allowed him to release a 
pole clone remotely by setting the HOLP in another

2:02:24.180,2:02:29.520
level beforehand, namely Whomp’s Fortress. With 
the preset HOLP, he was able to release a pole

2:02:29.520,2:02:34.140
clone here, in-between these two poles, and use 
it to navigate to and back from the red coin.

2:02:34.140,2:02:38.880
Pole clones are an exception to the one 
interaction rule. Mario can actually

2:02:38.880,2:02:42.900
reuse them as many times as he wants, because 
the interaction with a pole does absolutely

2:02:42.900,2:02:47.580
nothing to the pole’s interaction status, 
as opposed to enemies or coins. This let

2:02:47.580,2:02:50.880
him save an A press, but reintroduced 
the half A press entering the level,

2:02:50.880,2:02:55.560
bringing the star down from 2 to 1.5 A 
presses and saving one A press overall.

2:02:56.280,2:03:01.260
Shortly after, he also revisited Big House in 
the Sky, which was left at one A press for this

2:03:01.260,2:03:06.180
blue box, too high for VSC and not oriented 
properly for a misalignment. Of course,

2:03:06.180,2:03:10.200
that doesn’t mean it was impervious to 
Pannen magic. He figured out that an

2:03:10.200,2:03:14.160
exploding bob-omb could push Mario through the 
wall, and because the carpet would be inside,

2:03:14.160,2:03:19.320
he would have ground to stand on while inside 
the box. And because there are no inside walls,

2:03:19.320,2:03:21.720
he could get pushed back out 
easily on the other side.

2:03:21.720,2:03:27.180
But he was facing a pretty peculiar problem. 
In short, he wanted to bring a bob-omb to this

2:03:27.180,2:03:32.100
place while also having the carpet be active. 
This makes things a little complicated because

2:03:32.100,2:03:37.380
the carpet ride involves uses of VSC and those 
involve a dive recover, but diving with a bob-omb

2:03:37.380,2:03:42.360
in limbo automatically causes Mario to grab 
the bob-omb instead. This meant he needed to

2:03:42.360,2:03:46.920
somehow bring a bob-omb here, but also be able 
to perform VSC on the box immediately before.

2:03:46.920,2:03:52.260
Also, because cloning bob-ombs involved reaching 
the cruiser, he had to use Lakitu to get there,

2:03:52.260,2:03:57.120
which prevents the other Lakitu bounce used 
in this route. So, now, he had to figure out

2:03:57.120,2:04:01.920
a way to use two different bob-ombs to clip inside 
those two different boxes on the same carpet ride.

2:04:01.920,2:04:07.620
The solution he came up with was quite involved. 
First, he went up to the cruiser and cloned

2:04:07.620,2:04:12.240
a bob-omb which he dropped to break the cork 
box below. This simply frees up the space for

2:04:12.240,2:04:16.140
later. Then, he cloned another bob-omb, 
which he released in such a way that it

2:04:16.140,2:04:21.060
would eventually fall down to the platform below, 
but only after a bit of walking around. Finally,

2:04:21.060,2:04:24.840
he grabbed a third bob-omb, bloated this 
time, and carried it hands free to the

2:04:24.840,2:04:28.980
warp. Meanwhile, the walking bob-omb 
deactivates until Mario comes back.

2:04:29.760,2:04:35.340
Now, something interesting happens with bob-ombs 
after a hands free teleport. When Mario does a

2:04:35.340,2:04:40.200
hands free teleport, the bob-omb actually doesn’t 
follow him. It only does as soon as Mario enters

2:04:40.200,2:04:44.580
its activation radius, at which point it remembers 
it needs to hover invisibly in front of him, so it

2:04:44.580,2:04:49.140
snaps to his position. In this case, it happens 
that the warps are just a little bit further

2:04:49.140,2:04:54.420
apart than the activation radius. So, when Mario 
warps, the bob-omb stays on the red coin maze, and

2:04:54.420,2:04:58.620
Pannen makes sure to stay out of its activation 
radius until he’s ready to bring it back to Mario.

2:04:58.620,2:05:04.500
Once that bob-omb is positioned, he takes the 
carpet ride. This time, as he passes under the

2:05:04.500,2:05:09.540
bob-omb on the bridge, it reactivates and falls 
off below when he can retrieve it. He uses that

2:05:09.540,2:05:14.400
one to clip inside of the box that the lakitu 
bounce used to clear. Once he reaches this point,

2:05:14.400,2:05:19.440
he performs VSC just before entering this 
bob-omb’s activation range. He lets the

2:05:19.440,2:05:23.820
wall push him off the platform, since he can’t 
punch to inch forward, and now, he’s ready to

2:05:23.820,2:05:28.680
regrab that bob-omb from limbo, clip through the 
final box and save the last A press in this star.

2:05:29.340,2:05:34.140
After this madness, you’d think Pannenkoek 
would take a break from Rainbow Ride for a bit.

2:05:34.140,2:05:39.120
Well, you’d be wrong. He tried to apply the 
same bloated bob-omb hands free teleport

2:05:39.120,2:05:43.920
strategy to Tricky Triangles, but no matter 
how hard he tried, he couldn’t quite reach the

2:05:43.920,2:05:48.360
star. During that process though, he needed 
to get the Fly Guy in the perfect location,

2:05:48.360,2:05:52.440
and in doing so, he discovered a 
new technique: Fly Guy manipulation.

2:05:53.100,2:05:58.320
This is a bit of a complex one, so let me try 
and summarize it. Fly Guy has three states:

2:05:58.320,2:06:03.360
flying around, chasing Mario, and going back 
to its home. Again, like for all enemies,

2:06:03.360,2:06:07.860
Fly Guy’s home is a point in space that it 
will always try to fly back to when it strays

2:06:07.860,2:06:12.540
far away. If Fly Guy is currently far from 
its home, then it will try to go back home,

2:06:12.540,2:06:17.940
unless Mario is low enough below it, in which 
case it will chase Mario instead. This state

2:06:17.940,2:06:22.680
change only depends on the height difference, 
regardless of lateral distance. On top of that,

2:06:22.680,2:06:27.360
Fly Guy’s state can still be influenced even 
if Mario is outside of its activation radius.

2:06:27.360,2:06:31.620
Although it won’t move, it’s still able 
to change states, rotate and gain vertical

2:06:31.620,2:06:35.220
speed, affecting how it’s gonna behave 
whenever Mario enters its radius again.

2:06:35.220,2:06:40.860
The space below Fly Guy can be subdivided 
in three zones: high, medium and low. For

2:06:40.860,2:06:45.300
it to start chasing Mario, Mario needs to be 
in the low zone. Now, there’s a special case

2:06:45.300,2:06:50.220
that happens if it starts chasing Mario, and 
shortly after, Mario is in the high zone. Fly

2:06:50.220,2:06:55.680
Guy will then lunge at Mario instead, and gain 
significant vertical speed. If Mario activates

2:06:55.680,2:06:59.820
Fly Guy again at that time, it will lunge 
up and ahead, then return to a normal state.

2:07:00.420,2:07:05.340
Sometimes, Fly Guy can also start to spin in 
place while it’s in lunge mode. This behaviour

2:07:05.340,2:07:11.040
randomly occurs based on RNG, which can also be 
manipulated. By strategically reentering the low

2:07:11.040,2:07:15.840
zone, and back to the high zone, it’s possible 
to get Fly Guy to face any angle and lunge in

2:07:15.840,2:07:20.580
that direction when it’s activated again. With 
all of this in mind, it’s theoretically possible

2:07:20.580,2:07:24.720
to make Fly Guy go anywhere we want. 
Of course, provided that at all times,

2:07:24.720,2:07:28.920
there is an accessible point to manipulate its 
state, and another accessible point to activate

2:07:28.920,2:07:34.380
and deactivate it at will. In short, Fly Guy 
manipulation is possible, but it requires an

2:07:34.380,2:07:39.060
amount of planning and effort only matched thus 
far by a handful of the most ludicrous strategies.

2:07:39.600,2:07:44.100
So, with this new tool in hand, Pannenkoek 
was able to use a better way to reach the

2:07:44.100,2:07:48.480
Tricky Triangles star. He got the Fly Guy 
to lunge all the way to this platform,

2:07:48.480,2:07:52.080
where he could bounce on it and twirl 
directly to the star, saving an A press.

2:07:52.080,2:07:57.000
But now, there was an interesting question: 
would it be possible to get Fly Guy so far,

2:07:57.000,2:08:01.200
and so high up, that it could be used to go 
from the cruiser to the platform where the

2:08:01.200,2:08:05.760
Somewhere over the Rainbow star is? Was it 
even possible to reach the platform with a

2:08:05.760,2:08:11.580
single twirl? Tyler Kehne and Pannenkoek set off 
to answer that question. It took three weeks of

2:08:11.580,2:08:16.560
planning and testing and TASing, but they did 
it. The resulting route is too complicated to

2:08:16.560,2:08:21.660
break down step by step. The luring itself is 
a masterpiece - check out the notes for a link

2:08:21.660,2:08:26.460
to a video showing how it was done. Given the 
rudimentary tools they had at their disposition,

2:08:26.460,2:08:31.920
it’s impossible to overstate how astronomical 
the task to get Fly Guy across and up the entire

2:08:31.920,2:08:35.760
level was, while also juggling Lakitu 
for that bounce to reach the cruiser.

2:08:35.760,2:08:39.540
And now, after all this work, 
they had Fly Guy at the very

2:08:39.540,2:08:44.680
top of the cruiser’s mast. It was 
time for the final tour de force.

2:08:50.940,2:08:53.220
And with this incredibly tight twirl,

2:08:53.220,2:08:57.360
one of the unlikeliest A presses 
to ever be saved was now gone.

2:09:00.120,2:09:04.980
But Fly Guy manipulation wasn’t limited 
to only Rainbow Ride. It turns out that

2:09:04.980,2:09:09.540
Snowman’s Land also has a Fly Guy, and that 
level still had one pesky A press left,

2:09:09.540,2:09:15.000
in Snowman’s Big Head. Using shell hyperspeed, 
Pannen was able to ascend steep slopes all the

2:09:15.000,2:09:19.260
way up to the ice bridge, and from there, a 
carefully manipulated Fly Guy lunged into him,

2:09:19.260,2:09:24.300
sending him flying up to the star. Snowman’s 
Land was now fully done in 0 A presses.

2:09:24.300,2:09:29.040
Meanwhile, Tyler Kehne and Plush were hard at 
work to pull off another creative strategy,

2:09:29.040,2:09:34.080
in the volcano of Lethal Lava Land. Lava 
boosting can be used to gain a great amount

2:09:34.080,2:09:38.880
of height at once, at the cost of 3 sectors 
of health. So, while it is a very useful tool,

2:09:38.880,2:09:42.480
it can only be used twice, otherwise 
it would kill Mario. However,

2:09:42.480,2:09:48.120
there’s one way to get around this limitation: 
refilling Mario’s health midway. Spinning hearts

2:09:48.120,2:09:51.660
heal Mario when he runs through them. 
The faster he runs through a heart,

2:09:51.660,2:09:56.400
the faster it will spin, which in turn refills 
Mario’s health faster and for a longer time.

2:09:56.400,2:10:01.200
So, this is what they came up with: first, they 
get some height to do a slidekick bounce into

2:10:01.200,2:10:05.640
the lava waterfall, in order to reach the high 
bridge with two lava boosts. There’s nothing

2:10:05.640,2:10:11.040
funky going on here: Mario bouncing on lava with 
a slidekick is purely intended behaviour. Then,

2:10:11.040,2:10:16.020
they go over to the spinning heart and dive 
into it, touching it with roughly 48 speed. That

2:10:16.020,2:10:21.060
causes the heart to spin faster and longer than 
usual, giving Mario a lot of health back. They

2:10:21.060,2:10:25.860
use that to get back up with higher health than 
before, pick up coins to fill Mario’s health up,

2:10:25.860,2:10:30.660
and use another lava bounce to reach this higher 
platform. But they’ll need better to get to

2:10:30.660,2:10:35.700
the star. So they slidekick bounce back to the 
lava waterfall, picking up the last two coins,

2:10:35.700,2:10:40.440
and they now have just enough health for two more 
lava bounces that give Mario barely enough height

2:10:40.440,2:10:45.480
and distance to cross the gap to the highest 
platform in the volcano. That brought Hot-Foot-It

2:10:45.480,2:10:50.700
into the Volcano to 0 A presses, and Elevator 
Tour in the Volcano from 2 down to 1 A press.

2:10:51.480,2:10:56.160
During that time, Pannenkoek was working on 
Vanish Cap Under the Moat. While the other

2:10:56.160,2:10:59.880
special cap switches had features allowing 
to get on top of them without jumping,

2:10:59.880,2:11:04.140
the blue switch was problematic, because there 
was nothing to work with. On top of that,

2:11:04.140,2:11:08.160
even new discoveries didn’t seem to 
help. There was no star to work with,

2:11:08.160,2:11:12.120
no nearby ledge to use VSC, and while 
the switch did have a misalignment,

2:11:12.120,2:11:18.540
it was 247 units above the ground, too high 
for a 207-unit misalignment dive recover. But,

2:11:18.540,2:11:23.340
Pannen still wanted to test it. And in doing 
that, he found that the base of the switch also

2:11:23.340,2:11:28.860
has a misalignment at the same spot. So, by diving 
into that misalignment, he could get up 72 units,

2:11:28.860,2:11:34.560
then dive recover and ascend the remaining 
175 units using the second misalignment. All

2:11:34.560,2:11:39.420
special cap courses were now done in 0 A presses, 
including the A presses needed to reach them.

2:11:40.620,2:11:46.260
March 2015. The A press count is already 
down to 57, with two months to go until

2:11:46.260,2:11:50.160
the prediction’s deadline. At this rate, 
it still looks like Tyler Kehne might

2:11:50.160,2:11:54.180
get close with his guess of 54. And 
that’s when things took a wild turn.

2:11:54.180,2:12:00.000
Tyler was looking for a way to reach the piranha 
plants platform from the Tiny island painting. You

2:12:00.000,2:12:03.960
see, the problem with Tiny-Huge Island is that 
entering the huge painting takes an A press,

2:12:03.960,2:12:07.080
and entering the tiny painting leaves 
you stranded in the starting area.

2:12:07.080,2:12:11.340
Figuring out a way to get out of there would 
indirectly save an A press in the castle,

2:12:11.340,2:12:14.940
even if the star itself was 
already possible in 0 A presses.

2:12:14.940,2:12:20.940
He found a way to get across both gaps using tiny 
goombas. First, this one to bounce onto the middle

2:12:20.940,2:12:26.220
platform. And then, that one can fall off from 
above, and a precise dive recover could hit it and

2:12:26.220,2:12:30.720
bounce Mario to the piranha plants. From there, 
the pipe could be entered using a misalignment

2:12:30.720,2:12:36.180
on its outer corner, and the rest of the star was 
trivial. Pannenkoek got to work and, after 4 hours

2:12:36.180,2:12:41.760
of goomba manipulation, he managed to pull it 
off. One of the castle A presses had been saved.

2:12:41.760,2:12:47.040
But the story doesn’t end here. As it turns out, 
from this platform, the rest of the island is

2:12:47.040,2:12:51.960
painfully close to be fully accessible. There’s 
only this gap separating Mario from saving the

2:12:51.960,2:12:56.940
A press on every single Tiny-Huge Island stage 
entry, which would be massive. Unfortunately,

2:12:56.940,2:13:02.340
no misalignments can be exploited, and VSC can’t 
be used because the level geometry doesn’t allow

2:13:02.340,2:13:08.220
for it. There was one trick left in the bag of new 
discoveries: the star dance clip. Theoretically,

2:13:08.220,2:13:12.720
it would be possible to get up if a star 
was positioned perfectly in that gap. But

2:13:12.720,2:13:17.100
how do you get a 100-coin star here, of 
all places, with only access to a tiny

2:13:17.100,2:13:22.560
fraction of the island? You can’t, of course. 
Unless you’re Pannenkoek and Tyler Kehne.

2:13:22.560,2:13:27.720
Back in 2010, Pannen had already figured out a 
way to get infinite coins in Tiny-Huge Island,

2:13:27.720,2:13:32.760
and that method involves the piranha plants! 
If they are hit on the last possible frame as

2:13:32.760,2:13:37.080
they shrink back into the ground, piranha 
plants can give goins again. This process

2:13:37.080,2:13:41.940
can be repeated infinitely many times. 
However, once he did get to 99 coins,

2:13:41.940,2:13:45.720
Pannen still needed a way to get his 
100th coin precisely in that corner.

2:13:45.720,2:13:50.640
Thankfully, when a plant dies, the coins spring 
out in a direction and speed fully determined

2:13:50.640,2:13:54.960
by the RNG value. By manipulating 
that to be exactly what he wanted,

2:13:54.960,2:13:59.280
Pannen could get the coin to fly out 
directly to that corner. But this was

2:13:59.280,2:14:05.940
extremely precise. As it turns out, of the 65 
thousand possible RNG values, only 17 of them

2:14:05.940,2:14:10.620
would provide sufficient speed and the correct 
angle to make this possible. On top of that,

2:14:10.620,2:14:16.140
to milk all the extra distance he possibly could, 
Pannen also abused object tangibility mechanics.

2:14:16.140,2:14:21.900
Objects like cork boxes, elevator platforms, 
rotating platforms, seesaws and many others,

2:14:21.900,2:14:27.540
are only tangible if Mario is close enough to 
them. That distance is surprisingly short. As

2:14:27.540,2:14:31.620
soon as Mario walks away just a bit, other 
objects like coins or enemies will fall

2:14:31.620,2:14:36.060
through these platforms. If you pay close 
attention, you can actually see the coin

2:14:36.060,2:14:40.440
start falling through between each box. That’s 
Pannen using this mechanic so that the coin

2:14:40.440,2:14:44.880
would fall just enough to be pushed forward 
by the outer wall of this cork box. Then,

2:14:44.880,2:14:49.320
he enters that cork box’s tangibility radius 
just in time for it to catch the coin.

2:14:49.320,2:14:52.920
In the end, that was just enough to 
get the coin in the right spot before

2:14:52.920,2:14:57.360
it disappeared. From there, Pannen could do 
the star dance clip using the 100-coin star,

2:14:57.360,2:15:02.100
and he was now on the mainland in 0 
A presses from the tiny painting. And

2:15:02.100,2:15:06.960
that saved 5 A presses, once for every star 
in Tiny-Huge Island except the first one.

2:15:07.620,2:15:12.960
On the very same day, Pannen also found a way to 
get up from this point of Tick Tock Clock, to this

2:15:12.960,2:15:18.120
point, in only one A press instead of two. He did 
it by using a bob-omb to clone coins all the way

2:15:18.120,2:15:23.580
up to 99, then performing his usual shenanigans 
to reach this point with a bob-omb at hand. He

2:15:23.580,2:15:28.500
collects the coin right here, spawning the 100 
coin star, then uses VSC and a star dance clip to

2:15:28.500,2:15:33.720
get all the way up onto the ledge. From there, one 
A press is required to jump off the pole, so an A

2:15:33.720,2:15:38.760
press was saved in three different Tick Tock Clock 
stars, for a total of 8 A presses in a single day.

2:15:38.760,2:15:43.620
In the meantime, Pannenkoek was also very 
committed to saving the A press for Top o’

2:15:43.620,2:15:47.640
the Town, but no matter how hard he tried, 
no matter from what angle he looked at it,

2:15:47.640,2:15:51.600
he always hit a wall. He tried so 
many different strategies, in fact,

2:15:51.600,2:15:56.700
that he came up with a list of ten different 
actions. If even one single action from that

2:15:56.700,2:16:01.020
list could be done in 0 A presses, the 
star would be solved. Here they are.

2:16:01.560,2:16:06.780
Enter the painting at the high water level. Return 
from downtown on the low water level. Hold Chuckya

2:16:06.780,2:16:12.000
as a light object on its platform. Get Chuckya 
onto the plank. Get past the wall hitbox of the

2:16:12.000,2:16:16.320
star platform with less than 50 speed. Have at 
least 2 air frames while diving onto the spinning

2:16:16.320,2:16:21.720
platform at high speed. Have one more unit of room 
on the star platform. Bring a flame or a flame

2:16:21.720,2:16:26.760
clone onto the star platform. Get one more unit 
higher than a dive recover on the star platform,

2:16:26.760,2:16:33.600
and finally, be able to remotely open the star 
block. Pannenkoek was so close, yet so far. And

2:16:33.600,2:16:38.640
that’s when Plush discovered that it is possible 
to hold Chuckya as a light object on its platform.

2:16:38.640,2:16:44.460
Every object that can be carried around can 
be either light or heavy. When Mario carries a

2:16:44.460,2:16:49.260
light object, he can walk around fairly quickly, 
with the best animation in the entire game. If

2:16:49.260,2:16:54.420
the object is heavy, though, Mario’s movement is 
extremely limited. Also, the game always expects

2:16:54.420,2:16:59.220
you to grab heavy objects with a punch grab. 
You can’t dive grab Chuckya, and you would

2:16:59.220,2:17:04.200
never be expected to grab it in water either. 
So, those two grab actions always default to

2:17:04.200,2:17:09.059
the light object holding state, regardless of the 
weight of the actual object. But as it turns out,

2:17:09.060,2:17:14.160
you can, in fact, grab Chuckya in water. After 
that, Mario will be walking around as if he

2:17:14.160,2:17:19.260
was holding a bob-omb or a box. Unfortunately, 
for this star, that wasn’t quite useful enough.

2:17:19.260,2:17:24.780
The key new discovery was that it is possible to 
dive grab Chuckya, but only if it’s done a couple

2:17:24.780,2:17:29.639
of frames after punching. This can be achieved 
by standing right on the edge of a platform.

2:17:29.640,2:17:35.460
Shortly after punching, Mario starts falling 
and dives on the same frame. That allows him to

2:17:35.460,2:17:40.200
grab Chuckya and land back on the platform at the 
same time. Because he used the dive grab action,

2:17:40.200,2:17:44.939
Mario defaults to holding a light object, and he 
can carry Chuckya around with much more freedom.

2:17:44.939,2:17:49.859
Pannen used this to get Chuckya up onto the plank, 
and from there, he could carry it over to the

2:17:49.859,2:17:55.080
spinning platform, where he could get thrown into 
the star. Another easy A press save in the books.

2:17:56.280,2:18:00.899
You know, it’s been a whole 3 days since 
Pannenkoek last blew everybody’s mind with

2:18:00.899,2:18:04.859
a comically absurd, cryptic sequence 
that somehow comes together into an

2:18:04.859,2:18:08.820
absolute masterpiece. How about we 
go for a ride in Whomp’s Fortress?

2:18:08.820,2:18:13.559
The only A press left in that stage is 
in To the Top of the Fortress. But first,

2:18:13.560,2:18:18.600
a quick stop in Bob-omb Battlefield to place 
the HOLP in a convenient location. This is a

2:18:18.600,2:18:21.660
pretty high point, so a few goombas 
clones are needed to do the trick.

2:18:21.660,2:18:26.519
Now in Whomp’s Fortress, Pannen first uses the 
metal cap to perform the hat in hand glitch,

2:18:26.520,2:18:31.740
then collects some coins. The 100 coin star 
will come in handy here. He also throws a box,

2:18:31.740,2:18:40.019
but wait, where does it go? Ah, there it is. And 
there it goes again. Whoa, there it is! After

2:18:40.020,2:18:44.700
dropping it at the top of this slope, he finds 
it over there. As you may have guessed by now,

2:18:44.700,2:18:49.019
the HOLP that was set in Bob-omb Battlefield 
translates to a point high above this arrow

2:18:49.020,2:18:53.580
platform. Now, he uses that box to collect 
the 100th coin right next to the tower.

2:18:53.580,2:18:57.660
But he needs one more piece of the 
puzzle. He goes back down and gets

2:18:57.660,2:19:01.859
the other cork box in the stage. He plays 
catch with Schrödinger’s box some more,

2:19:01.859,2:19:05.219
and brings the box to the top 
as well. And now, don’t blink!

2:19:07.560,2:19:13.560
So, what just happened? As Mario threw the box, 
it warped to the HOLP. Pannenkoek placed it at

2:19:13.560,2:19:18.240
this exact position so that the box would land 
on the elevator platform at this precise angle.

2:19:18.240,2:19:22.080
Mario quickly gets into position with 
a pause-buffered dive recover before

2:19:22.080,2:19:26.220
the box falls on top of him and pushes 
him off the platform. He enters freefall

2:19:26.220,2:19:30.780
and ground pounds. Meanwhile, the box’s 
bounce trajectory perfectly follows him,

2:19:30.780,2:19:35.519
pushing him forward for the entire duration of 
the ground pound. This allows him to touch the

2:19:35.520,2:19:40.439
100 coin star much higher than would otherwise 
be possible. And from there, a simple star dance

2:19:40.439,2:19:44.460
clip gets him up the rest of the way onto this 
ledge, and the rest of the star is trivial.

2:19:44.460,2:19:49.560
This brought Whomp’s Fortress to 0 A presses, 
and the total A press count down to 45,

2:19:49.560,2:19:54.781
completely eclipsing every single prediction 
made by the ABC crew, with two months to spare.

2:19:55.380,2:20:00.120
But the next two months did not end up as 
fruitful as January and March were. Most

2:20:00.120,2:20:04.740
members of the ABC crew were busy with college 
and other responsibilities. Nonetheless,

2:20:04.740,2:20:09.179
a major advancement was made. This time, 
they got outside help from a speedrunner.

2:20:09.180,2:20:14.100
Japanese runner honey was practicing Bowser 
in the Sky, when he ran into this glitch by

2:20:14.100,2:20:18.120
complete accident. You can see the bob-omb 
disappear, but if you pay close attention,

2:20:18.120,2:20:22.680
you can see that it reappears way off in the 
distance. What could’ve possibly happened?

2:20:23.580,2:20:27.660
Soon enough, Tyler Kehne, Plush and 
Pannenkoek were on the case. They

2:20:27.660,2:20:30.300
eventually managed to recreate 
and understand what happened,

2:20:30.300,2:20:34.920
and that’s when they realized they had a shiny 
new tool to break the game with: instant release.

2:20:34.920,2:20:40.560
The way this works is actually very simple. It has 
to do with the fact that the held object’s last

2:20:40.560,2:20:45.300
position only updates if the held object needs 
to be visually updated. With instant release,

2:20:45.300,2:20:50.880
Mario bonks into a wall on the same frame that 
he grabs the object. Bonking automatically drops

2:20:50.880,2:20:55.200
the objet Mario is holding, so before the held 
object has any time to be drawn in Mario’s hands,

2:20:55.200,2:20:59.220
it’s already gone. Because the object is 
being dropped, it’s released at Mario’s

2:20:59.220,2:21:03.960
vertical position, but at the HOLP laterally. 
This is what is being observed in honey’s clip:

2:21:03.960,2:21:07.800
the HOLP was somewhere on this line, and 
the bob-omb was released at Mario’s height.

2:21:07.800,2:21:10.979
Now, this had important ramifications 
for the A Button Challenge,

2:21:10.979,2:21:14.819
because it was now possible to remote drop 
an object without the hat in hand glitch,

2:21:14.819,2:21:18.660
and without the massive restrictions of 
transport cloning. The only restriction

2:21:18.660,2:21:23.040
this time was there had to be a way to grab the 
object and bonk into a wall at the same time.

2:21:23.640,2:21:28.319
This new technique immediately found a use 
in Tick Tock Clock. By setting up the HOLP

2:21:28.319,2:21:33.359
in Wet-Dry World beforehand, Pannen is able to use 
instant release to warp a bob-omb out of bounds,

2:21:33.359,2:21:37.679
far enough away that Mario is out of its 
activation radius. Then he uses the other

2:21:37.680,2:21:43.020
bob-omb to clone coins and gets all the way 
to 97. Then, he places a flame clone under

2:21:43.020,2:21:47.460
the ledge. Of course, as he releases it, 
he instantly gets burned, which uses up the

2:21:47.460,2:21:51.720
clone. But all he has to do is clone a new 
flame and release it next to the first one,

2:21:51.720,2:21:55.260
just like he had done with goombas before, 
and this second clone would be usable.

2:21:55.260,2:22:00.060
After that, he collects these coins, making sure 
to clone one of them to collect it right under the

2:22:00.060,2:22:04.979
ledge, spawning the 100 coin star exactly where 
he wants it to be. And now, everything is in place

2:22:04.979,2:22:10.319
for the magic to unfold. A dive recover into a 
flame bounce into a star dance clip gets him all

2:22:10.319,2:22:15.059
the way up to the ledge. From there, dive recovers 
get him up the cogs, where the bob-omb magically

2:22:15.060,2:22:19.620
appears. This is because as soon as Mario 
enters the bob-omb’s radius, it’s reactivated,

2:22:19.620,2:22:24.000
but because it was dropped out of bounds, the 
game puts it at Mario’s position as a failsafe.

2:22:24.000,2:22:28.859
And now, he gets across to the cage, and uses 
VSC to reach the star, finally lowering Roll

2:22:28.859,2:22:33.960
into the Cage to 0 A presses, a feat that seemed 
absolutely impossible not even two years before.

2:22:34.859,2:22:40.439
And Pannenkoek was not even done in Tick Tock 
Clock. The red coin star, sitting at 0 A presses

2:22:40.439,2:22:45.359
for a while now, could obviously no longer 
be improved. But that didn’t stop Pannen from

2:22:45.359,2:22:51.660
trying anyway. And that’s when he came up with 
something truly incredible: negative A presses.

2:22:52.200,2:22:54.780
Okay, not really, but this is the next best thing.

2:22:54.780,2:22:59.460
Tick Tock Clock always takes one A press to 
enter because the clock face is so high up.

2:22:59.460,2:23:04.380
But what if there was a way to collect a star in 
such a way that once Mario returns to the castle,

2:23:04.380,2:23:09.780
he’s somehow able to reenter the stage without 
the required A press? It seems impossible,

2:23:09.780,2:23:13.139
because changing maps like that 
resets almost every variable and

2:23:13.140,2:23:16.500
strips control away from the player 
until the celebration is over.

2:23:16.500,2:23:21.120
But there’s one glitch that can still affect 
Mario despite all that: spawning displacement.

2:23:21.120,2:23:25.859
When Mario is standing on a moving platform 
that suddenly disappears, the platform will

2:23:25.859,2:23:30.660
displace him for one additional frame despite 
no longer existing. When the platform unloads

2:23:30.660,2:23:34.979
because of Mario exiting the level via the 
pause menu, collecting a star or even dying,

2:23:34.979,2:23:38.759
this extra frame of displacement is applied 
to Mario as he spawns in the castle.

2:23:38.760,2:23:44.399
Now, for a regular moving platform, this effect 
is barely noticeable. But for a rotating platform,

2:23:44.399,2:23:48.660
displacement is applied as a rotation 
from the platform’s center. As such,

2:23:48.660,2:23:52.439
objects are moved proportionally to 
their distance to the center. And

2:23:52.439,2:23:54.780
that is precisely why this glitch can be useful.

2:23:54.780,2:23:59.819
Here’s what Pannenkoek did. He cloned the 
red coin star using one of the bob-ombs,

2:23:59.819,2:24:03.540
and collected it while standing on the 
moving spinner. The level unloads with

2:24:03.540,2:24:08.220
the spinner rotating clockwise and Mario still 
standing on it. Now, when the castle loads,

2:24:08.220,2:24:12.000
it occupies the same coordinate system 
as Tick Tock Clock, but in a completely

2:24:12.000,2:24:16.200
different way. The position of the spinner 
in Tick Tock Clock ends up far enough away

2:24:16.200,2:24:21.660
from where Mario is spawned that the rotational 
displacement is greatly magnified. As a result,

2:24:21.660,2:24:25.800
Mario is moved down significantly enough that 
he ends up landing on the clock instead of

2:24:25.800,2:24:30.180
in front of it. One of the six A presses 
to enter Tick Tock Clock had been saved.

2:24:30.180,2:24:34.979
There’s just one tiny caveat: this glitch 
was fixed immediately after release, which

2:24:34.979,2:24:39.359
means that it is only present in the Japanese 
version of the game. In every subsequent release,

2:24:39.359,2:24:43.259
including North American and PAL, this 
glitch has been patched. Therefore,

2:24:43.260,2:24:47.520
this A press save came with an asterisk: 
it had to be done on the Japanese Nintendo

2:24:47.520,2:24:51.240
64 version of the game. This is 
as valid a version as any other,

2:24:51.240,2:24:54.780
so there was no inherent problem with it, 
but it’s just something to keep in mind.

2:24:54.780,2:24:59.099
Another unfortunate detail is that while 
this looked extremely promising at first,

2:24:59.100,2:25:02.160
it actually couldn’t be used for 
any other Tick Tock Clock star,

2:25:02.160,2:25:07.080
because since they’re all already present from 
stage load, they cannot be cloned. Collecting

2:25:07.080,2:25:10.740
a star on a moving platform, especially 
with conditions as precise as they need

2:25:10.740,2:25:14.639
to be to save the re-entry A press, was 
simply not possible for any other star.

2:25:16.080,2:25:21.899
May 2015. Bob-omb Battlefield had been 
mostly solved for over four years now,

2:25:21.899,2:25:27.000
ever since the 20-star 0 A press TAS. 
There was just one single A press left,

2:25:27.000,2:25:31.920
but it was a tough one. Mario Wings to the 
Sky, with its coins high up in the air,

2:25:31.920,2:25:37.500
always looked like one of those stars that would 
never be done in 0 A presses. It’s impossible for

2:25:37.500,2:25:42.120
Mario to start flying without a triple jump or 
a cannon shot, both of which require an A press,

2:25:42.120,2:25:45.960
and while shell hyperspeed could be 
used to reach the first three coins,

2:25:45.960,2:25:52.020
getting these two without flying was unthinkable. 
There was the outside possibility of using goomba

2:25:52.020,2:25:56.460
clones to reach the coins, but because of the 
exponential nature of goomba bridges, that was

2:25:56.460,2:26:01.979
quickly ruled out as impossible without a major 
breakthrough. And a major breakthrough is exactly

2:26:01.979,2:26:07.319
what happened. Just one week after spawning 
displacement, Pannenkoek shocked the world when

2:26:07.319,2:26:12.540
he put to use the latest advancements in goomba 
engineering: the goomba cluster and goomba oasis.

2:26:12.540,2:26:16.800
I mentioned before that when Mario 
throws an object, to help create a

2:26:16.800,2:26:20.640
seamless transition during Mario’s throwing 
animation, the object is warped to the HOLP,

2:26:20.640,2:26:26.580
but not to its exact position. To be more precise, 
the object is warped 32 units ahead of the HOLP,

2:26:26.580,2:26:30.840
in whichever direction Mario is facing. 
This means that if two objects are thrown

2:26:30.840,2:26:35.399
remotely to the same HOLP while Mario is facing 
different angles, the two objects will end up

2:26:35.399,2:26:40.139
at slightly different positions. Goombas 
with partially overlapping hitboxes can

2:26:40.140,2:26:45.060
be interacted with one by one with the right 
positioning. This is called a goomba cluster.

2:26:45.060,2:26:49.859
In the past, a goomba bridge had to be 
built by placing the HOLP for every goomba,

2:26:49.859,2:26:53.040
causing the amount of goombas in a 
bridge to increase exponentially with

2:26:53.040,2:26:57.600
its length. With this new key development, 
multiple goombas could be released at the

2:26:57.600,2:27:02.220
same HOLP but at slightly different angles, 
allowing the HOLP to be reused. Therefore,

2:27:02.220,2:27:06.180
the bridge could be built by placing the 
HOLP only once for every step of the bridge.

2:27:06.180,2:27:11.100
Any given step of the bridge only required 
one goomba clone for every step beyond it,

2:27:11.100,2:27:15.720
causing the amount of goombas in the bridge to 
only increase quadratically with its length. So,

2:27:15.720,2:27:21.660
a bridge of length 8 that would have required 
255 goombas in the past only required 36 now.

2:27:21.660,2:27:26.099
But 36 goombas is still a high enough 
number that you can’t build two of those

2:27:26.100,2:27:31.080
bridges without crashing the game, so both 
coins had to be collected in one go. Just

2:27:31.080,2:27:34.920
reaching the general area where the fourth 
and fifth coins were located wasn’t enough:

2:27:34.920,2:27:38.399
there needed to be something there to 
help Mario stay in the air long enough

2:27:38.399,2:27:43.559
to maneuver between the two coins. This is 
where the goomba oasis came to save the day.

2:27:43.560,2:27:49.140
The idea is actually fairly simple. Transport 
cloning moves the object to the halfway point

2:27:49.140,2:27:53.399
between its original position and the HOLP 
laterally, but to the HOLP’s Y coordinate.

2:27:53.399,2:27:59.339
When the original object is a goomba, its original 
position isn’t always the same. Like most enemies,

2:27:59.340,2:28:03.840
goombas have a radius around their home in 
which they can run around freely. Therefore,

2:28:03.840,2:28:08.819
even if the HOLP is fixed, two goomba clones 
released via transport cloning can end up in

2:28:08.819,2:28:13.259
different locations. In other words, for 
any given HOLP and a goomba’s home circle,

2:28:13.260,2:28:17.160
transport cloning can move that goomba to 
a circle half the size of the original,

2:28:17.160,2:28:21.359
and halfway between the goomba’s home and 
the HOLP laterally, at the HOLP’s height.

2:28:21.359,2:28:26.160
More specifically, transport cloning could 
allow any amount of goombas to be placed

2:28:26.160,2:28:31.019
anywhere inside of this circle, using 
one single HOLP. This is a goomba oasis.

2:28:31.560,2:28:37.140
Here’s exactly what Pannen did. First, he needed 
to place the HOLP here, at just about the fifth

2:28:37.140,2:28:41.340
coin’s height, so that the resulting transport 
cloning zone would cover the space around the

2:28:41.340,2:28:47.040
fourth and fifth coins. He did so by using 28 
goombas to build a goomba bridge of length 7 using

2:28:47.040,2:28:52.140
goomba clusters. Once the HOLP was set in the 
correct spot, he could pause exit and reenter the

2:28:52.140,2:28:57.300
level to get rid of all of these goomba clones. 
After collecting the first three coins with shell

2:28:57.300,2:29:02.939
hyperspeed, he could start cloning goombas again. 
He built a goomba oasis in this zone by transport

2:29:02.939,2:29:08.280
cloning 7 goombas from this trio at various 
positions. Those would help guide Mario between

2:29:08.280,2:29:13.139
the two highest coins. If you look closely, 
you’ll notice that because of transport cloning’s

2:29:13.140,2:29:17.520
limitations, the goombas are all at the exact 
same height, which is the HOLP’s Y coordinate.

2:29:17.520,2:29:22.260
Then, he built a goomba bridge of length 8 to 
reach this point from the top of the mountain,

2:29:22.260,2:29:28.440
using 36 goombas. Once everything was in place, 
he could finally pull off this masterpiece.

2:29:29.340,2:29:34.020
To reiterate, this A press save was made 
possible by the ability of the goomba

2:29:34.020,2:29:39.240
cluster and the goomba oasis to reuse one HOLP 
to place multiple goomba clones, which greatly

2:29:39.240,2:29:43.679
lowers the amount of clones needed to move 
the HOLP and build complex goomba structures.

2:29:45.060,2:29:50.399
Meanwhile, a TASer by the name of Kyman showed 
something interesting to the ABC crew: in Dire

2:29:50.399,2:29:54.839
Dire Docks, if you end up holding a whirlpool 
clone and release it, Mario will spiral around

2:29:54.840,2:29:59.819
it and die. But if you release it right next to 
the loading zone and Mario crosses the plane as

2:29:59.819,2:30:04.740
he’s spiraling, the whirlpool unloads and is 
replaced with another object. Mario will then

2:30:04.740,2:30:10.080
spin around this new object. However, because most 
of the time, this new object is very far away,

2:30:10.080,2:30:15.960
the rotation quickly flings Mario out of bounds, 
killing him instantly. On paper, given an object

2:30:15.960,2:30:20.160
far out of bounds at just the right place, it 
would be possible for Mario to spin into the

2:30:20.160,2:30:25.500
pole that leads to this boxed red coin. But in 
reality, such a scenario simply wasn’t possible,

2:30:25.500,2:30:30.540
and so the idea, as promising as it was, 
was shelved. For about a couple of days.

2:30:30.540,2:30:35.100
Kyman had one clip that Tyler Kehne 
and Pannenkoek couldn’t make sense of,

2:30:35.100,2:30:39.660
where Mario ended up spinning wildly around 
the first area of the level. What didn’t make

2:30:39.660,2:30:44.580
sense was that Mario seemingly warped across the 
entire map before he started spinning. But then,

2:30:44.580,2:30:49.260
Pannen realized what was happening. The 
glitch isn’t that Mario warps across the map:

2:30:49.260,2:30:53.820
it’s that he doesn’t when he should. 
This is No translation loading.

2:30:54.479,2:31:00.660
Levels are always contained within a square 
between negative and positive 8192 in both

2:31:00.660,2:31:06.120
directions. Dire Dire Docks is bigger than that: 
this is why it’s cut up into two rooms with a

2:31:06.120,2:31:10.319
loading zone in between. The rooms occupy 
the same space in the coordinate system,

2:31:10.319,2:31:14.639
so the end of the tunnel in the first room doesn’t 
line up with the same point in the second room.

2:31:14.640,2:31:19.080
When Mario crosses the loading trigger and the 
loaded area switches from one to the other,

2:31:19.080,2:31:23.340
he needs to be translated to the same 
location in the new room. The offset

2:31:23.340,2:31:29.520
happens to be 8192 units, or half the size 
of the map. This translation happens every

2:31:29.520,2:31:33.180
time Mario crosses the loading trigger 
and it results in a seamless experience.

2:31:33.180,2:31:37.319
Now, if Mario is spinning around a 
whirlpool clone, he can end up crossing

2:31:37.319,2:31:42.120
the loading zone in an unconventional way. The 
whirlpool spins Mario towards out of bounds,

2:31:42.120,2:31:46.080
but he crosses the loading zone, so he 
ends up in bounds in the new room. The

2:31:46.080,2:31:50.040
game tries to translate him to match the new 
coordinate system, but doing so would place

2:31:50.040,2:31:54.300
him out of bounds. Unlike the rotation 
from the whirlpool, which can send Mario

2:31:55.020,2:31:58.080
out of bounds, the loading zone translation 
can’t put him out of bounds, so it chooses

2:31:58.080,2:32:02.460
not to move him at all. This is how he ends up 
in the middle of the first room out of nowhere.

2:32:03.180,2:32:07.800
Once he understood the implications of this 
discovery, Pannenkoek got to work and used

2:32:07.800,2:32:12.600
it to save the A press to reach the final red 
coin. He ended up finding a set of conditions

2:32:12.600,2:32:17.399
that worked perfectly. First, he placed the HOLP 
in the second room in a point that corresponds

2:32:17.399,2:32:21.899
to just outside of the tunnel in the first 
room. Then, he remote released a whirlpool

2:32:21.899,2:32:27.059
clone using the hat in hand glitch. When Mario 
gets caught in, he starts spinning towards out

2:32:27.060,2:32:31.560
of bounds. As he crosses the loading zone, 
the translation failsafe is triggered and

2:32:31.560,2:32:35.760
so he ends up in the middle of this room. Now, 
he would keep spinning around the whirlpool,

2:32:35.760,2:32:41.040
but it unloaded and was replaced by this cork 
box. Therefore, he now spins around this box on

2:32:41.040,2:32:45.720
an arc that conveniently happens to pass right 
on the corner of this platform. Fortunately,

2:32:45.720,2:32:49.800
Mario touching the floor interrupts the spin 
- otherwise, he would keep spinning to his

2:32:49.800,2:32:54.420
eventual death. From there, he can reach the 
final red coin with no additional A press.

2:32:54.420,2:32:59.220
Note that for Mario to be able to swim with the 
shell and clone stuff, the A button needs to be

2:32:59.220,2:33:05.640
held throughout, so the star went from 1.5 to 
0.5 A presses. Despite being well established

2:33:05.640,2:33:10.020
in the A Button Challenge, the half A press 
notation never failed to confuse new viewers.

2:33:10.800,2:33:15.359
At the same time, in Jolly Roger Bay, Pannen and 
Tyler were working on a way to pound the blue

2:33:15.359,2:33:20.519
coin box without an A press for the 100-coin star. 
They knew that a goomba bounce would do the trick,

2:33:20.520,2:33:24.660
but these goombas’ homes were too far 
from the box. Running into the goombas

2:33:24.660,2:33:28.559
could give a bit of extra distance, but 
not enough to make it possible. Until

2:33:28.560,2:33:32.880
Tyler found a clever abuse of the goomba’s 
mechanics called the goomba chase extension.

2:33:33.540,2:33:39.000
A goomba chasing after Mario will quit chasing him 
if it moves too far from its home, if Mario moves

2:33:39.000,2:33:44.220
too far from its home, or if Mario moves too far 
from the goomba itself. The goomba chases Mario

2:33:44.220,2:33:49.859
by setting its target angle towards him. However, 
if the goomba walks into a ledge, a steep slope,

2:33:49.859,2:33:54.780
a wall or another goomba, it recalculates its 
current target angle, which means it’s no longer

2:33:54.780,2:34:00.420
targeting Mario. After that, it turns until it 
faces the new target angle, then stops chasing.

2:34:00.420,2:34:06.180
After carefully manipulating goombas, Pannen was 
able to get a goomba to chase Mario, then run into

2:34:06.180,2:34:11.220
the rock, then into the wall, then into the other 
goomba. So, before it has time to face its target

2:34:11.220,2:34:16.439
angle, it runs into a new obstacle that causes 
it to recalculate its target angle and extend its

2:34:16.439,2:34:21.359
chase. Finally, it runs close enough to the box 
that Mario can bounce on it and save an A press.

2:34:22.140,2:34:28.920
July 2015. The addition of Tyler Kehne to the ABC 
crew had ushered the A Button challenge into a new

2:34:28.920,2:34:33.960
golden era. The introduction of vertical speed 
conservation, misalignments and star dance clips

2:34:33.960,2:34:38.880
revolutionized the challenge like only Pannenkoek 
had done before. In the past year and a half,

2:34:38.880,2:34:44.640
the A press count had been lowered by 
an incredible 80%, from 208 to 40. While

2:34:44.640,2:34:49.260
Pannenkoek and Tyler were showing no signs of 
stopping, each additional A press was becoming

2:34:49.260,2:34:55.140
harder and harder to save. Options were starting 
to dry out. But Tyler Kehne hadn’t even made

2:34:55.140,2:35:00.840
his most legendary contribution yet. It was 
time for Mario to enter parallel universes.

2:35:10.800,2:35:16.620
On July 11th, Tyler Kehne was looking for ways to 
get even more speed than the 500 from repeatedly

2:35:16.620,2:35:21.359
sliding on this slope. He found this corner, 
where the open gate created a ceiling barrier.

2:35:21.359,2:35:26.339
Because he’s walking uphill on a slippery slope, 
Mario accelerates backwards, but he’s right up

2:35:26.340,2:35:31.920
against a ceiling. Unlike walls, ceilings don’t 
push Mario sideways out of their hitbox. If Mario

2:35:31.920,2:35:37.080
is in the air and moves forward into a ceiling, 
that will result in a bonk. As a quick aside,

2:35:37.080,2:35:42.359
ceiling hitboxes technically extend infinitely 
upwards, unless there’s a floor above them. The

2:35:42.359,2:35:46.920
annoyance commonly referred to as invisible 
walls is actually caused by exposed ceilings

2:35:46.920,2:35:50.819
that don’t have a floor directly above 
them, usually due to imperfect geometry.

2:35:50.819,2:35:55.859
When Mario is on the ground and about to enter a 
ceiling hitbox or out of bounds, he simply doesn’t

2:35:55.859,2:36:00.420
move at all. He still conserves his speed, but 
he looks like he’s pushing up against something

2:36:00.420,2:36:06.060
and he stays in place. This is what Tyler uses to 
accumulate hundreds of speed: the underside of the

2:36:06.060,2:36:10.740
gate is a ceiling that prevents Mario from moving 
into it. Once Mario has enough speed to completely

2:36:10.740,2:36:16.319
bypass the ceiling, he breaks out of this spot 
and zooms across the room into the water. Instead

2:36:16.319,2:36:22.559
of the 500 speed that Plush achieved using the 
middle island, Mario now has 1700 speed. But then,

2:36:22.560,2:36:27.660
Tyler found that Mario could turn around to have 
his back facing out of bounds. The ceiling had a

2:36:27.660,2:36:29.446
limit, but out of bounds is infinite. Tyler 
Kehne had discovered infinite speed without

2:36:29.446,2:36:33.840
the A button. Immediately, this discovery 
was used to improve Watch for Rolling Rocks.

2:36:33.840,2:36:38.040
This star had always had the problem 
of requiring Mario to reach one of the

2:36:38.040,2:36:42.180
highest points in the entire level. 
Despite the ABC crew’s best efforts,

2:36:42.180,2:36:46.979
the intended wall kick strategy was still optimal, 
so it had been sitting at 2 A presses since the

2:36:46.979,2:36:53.519
dawn of time. But this was about to change. With 
so much stored speed, Mario could simply do this.

2:37:01.319,2:37:07.740
How does that work? Well, again, it’s surprisingly 
simple. Mario exits water on Dorrie’s slippery

2:37:07.740,2:37:13.019
back, reactivating the stored sliding speed. 
Then, he enters freefall and lands on the path.

2:37:13.020,2:37:18.899
As he lands, he instantly jumps. I’ve mentioned 
this before, but this is now critically relevant:

2:37:18.899,2:37:24.299
the vertical speed of Mario’s jump is a function 
of his horizontal speed. The faster he goes,

2:37:24.300,2:37:29.790
the higher he jumps. With 1500 speed, one 
jump gets him enough vertical speed to soar

2:37:29.790,2:37:34.620
to the upper limit of the stage. But if 
he has so much speed, how come he jumps

2:37:34.620,2:37:40.680
straight up? Because he dives! Like I said 
before, a dive increases Mario speed by 15,

2:37:40.680,2:37:47.939
up to a maximum of 48. Well, this 48 is a hard 
cap. If Mario is moving at 33 speed or higher

2:37:47.939,2:37:53.160
and he dives, regardless of how fast he was 
going, his speed will be set to exactly 48.

2:37:53.160,2:37:57.479
Even though Mario jumps and dives on the 
same frame, the initial vertical speed of

2:37:57.479,2:38:02.280
his jump is calculated before the hard cap 
of 48 is applied to his horizontal speed,

2:38:02.280,2:38:07.319
so he inherits this astronomical vertical speed 
while stopping his horizontal momentum before

2:38:07.319,2:38:12.120
he smashes against the edge of the map. From 
there, Mario can slowly navigate above the

2:38:12.120,2:38:16.680
level and fall onto the star, bringing down 
this relic of the past to one single A press.

2:38:19.020,2:38:24.240
With this new tool in hand, Hazy Maze Cave 
looked much more solvable than before. The

2:38:24.240,2:38:28.859
stage was down to three A presses, in Watch 
for Rolling Rocks, A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit,

2:38:28.859,2:38:33.780
and the red coin star. In order to make this newly 
found high speed in the cavern useful, though,

2:38:33.780,2:38:38.700
there needed to be a way to bring the speed up 
the level without jumping. The answer was simple:

2:38:38.700,2:38:43.740
just take the elevator. But there was one 
problem: when Mario has this much speed,

2:38:43.740,2:38:48.899
his next intended position is out of bounds, so 
he can’t move. Mario ends up staying in place

2:38:48.899,2:38:54.359
while the elevator moves through him. Until Plush 
and sonicpacker had something to say about it.

2:38:54.359,2:38:58.920
When Mario is about to go out of bounds, 
only his horizontal displacement is canceled,

2:38:58.920,2:39:04.260
not his vertical movement. By kicking repeatedly, 
Mario moves up and can stay on the elevator,

2:39:04.260,2:39:08.819
at the cost of a bit of speed and a half 
A press. This allows Mario to go nearly

2:39:08.819,2:39:13.019
anywhere in the level with a very high 
horizontal speed. Plush figured out a

2:39:13.020,2:39:16.260
route that would carry Mario all the 
way up to A-Maze-ing Emergency exit,

2:39:16.260,2:39:21.240
but he ran out of speed a little too quickly and 
couldn’t clip through the final door. Pannenkoek

2:39:21.240,2:39:27.000
took over and optimized it just enough to make it 
possible and bring the star down to 0.5 A presses.

2:39:27.660,2:39:32.099
Meanwhile, the red coin star could get the same 
treatment, but Pannen needed a tiny bit of height

2:39:32.100,2:39:36.899
to get past this gap and navigate to the red 
coins room. It was time to ask his old friend the

2:39:36.899,2:39:42.540
scuttlebug for help. Up until now, every enemy’s 
home has always been a fixed point. This is

2:39:42.540,2:39:48.359
true for Chuckya, Fly Guy, goombas, bob-ombs and 
scuttlebugs alike. But there is an exception. If a

2:39:48.359,2:39:53.519
scuttlebug runs into Mario, its home will move to 
its current position, effectively redefining the

2:39:53.520,2:39:58.439
zone it can move in. This can happen infinitely 
many times, which means a scuttlebug can move

2:39:58.439,2:40:03.239
arbitrarily far, provided that Mario has enough 
health to take a beating. Fortunately, there

2:40:03.240,2:40:08.280
is a spinning heart right here. Unfortunately, 
scuttlebugs can’t travel across the entire level

2:40:08.280,2:40:13.380
at will. They can’t go through doors, so they’re 
actually confined to their room. Here though,

2:40:13.380,2:40:18.479
it wasn’t necessary, because Pannen only needed 
the scuttlebug to move close to the door. Then,

2:40:18.479,2:40:22.620
he gathered some speed, took the elevator 
up, and bounced on the scuttlebug to cross

2:40:22.620,2:40:28.620
the gap and complete his trip to the red coin 
room. Another star brought to 0.5 A presses.

2:40:28.620,2:40:33.300
The only star remaining was Watch for 
Rolling Rocks. Getting it down to 1 A

2:40:33.300,2:40:37.260
press with hyperspeed had been relatively 
simple, but the task of bringing it to

2:40:37.260,2:40:42.300
0.5 was something else entirely. Although this 
platform could be reached like we saw earlier,

2:40:42.300,2:40:47.040
it could only be ledge grabbed, which kills 
Mario’s momentum. It also wasn’t high enough:

2:40:47.040,2:40:52.080
the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform is 
significantly higher. Pannenkoek wasn’t

2:40:52.080,2:40:57.059
deterred. He still had a few ideas to make 
it work, including Tyler Kehne’s discovery

2:40:57.060,2:41:01.620
of infinite speed with hyperspeed walking. 
It would require a lot more time and effort,

2:41:01.620,2:41:04.680
though, and so that star remained 
at 1 A press for the time being­.

2:41:05.340,2:41:08.399
While it couldn’t quite be used 
for Watch for Rolling Rocks,

2:41:08.399,2:41:12.899
infinite speed in Hazy Maze Cave turned 
out to have an unexpected application. It

2:41:12.899,2:41:16.979
was used to solve one of very few remaining 
trivial A presses of the entire challenge,

2:41:16.979,2:41:21.000
in what is perhaps the starkest contrast 
between the complexity of the 1 A press

2:41:21.000,2:41:27.120
and the 0 A press strategy: entering the Secret 
Aquarium. Buckle up because this is a big one.

2:41:27.120,2:41:32.819
First of all, how can speed in one level have 
any effect on the castle interior? Again,

2:41:32.819,2:41:38.519
the key ingredient is sliding speed conservation. 
Swimming is a situation where sliding speed and

2:41:38.520,2:41:43.260
horizontal speed no longer line up, but it’s 
not the only one. During a stage transition,

2:41:43.260,2:41:47.939
like a death, a pause exit or entering a 
pipe, the horizontal speed is reset to zero,

2:41:47.939,2:41:52.799
but the sliding speed isn’t. In almost every 
case, though, the sliding speed is set to zero

2:41:52.800,2:41:57.540
immediately after the transition, so it makes 
no difference. But in the case of a pause exit,

2:41:57.540,2:42:01.260
it’s possible for Mario to crouch on the 
very first frame after the transition.

2:42:01.260,2:42:06.359
When Mario is crouching, he automatically 
starts sliding if he has any momentum. So,

2:42:06.359,2:42:09.719
by crouching immediately after a 
pause exit with stored sliding speed,

2:42:09.720,2:42:12.840
Mario can conserve that sliding 
speed through the stage transition.

2:42:12.840,2:42:18.359
However, exiting a stage with stored sliding speed 
is not as simple as it looks: Mario normally needs

2:42:18.359,2:42:23.639
to be considered idle for the exit level option to 
be available in the first place. If Mario is idle,

2:42:23.640,2:42:29.040
then he’s by definition not moving. It is 
nonetheless possible in a few specific cases where

2:42:29.040,2:42:33.720
either the sliding speed isn’t being updated, such 
as when Mario is in water or holding onto a pole,

2:42:33.720,2:42:38.160
or it hasn’t had time to update, like on the 
first frame of a ledge grab, landing from a twirl,

2:42:38.160,2:42:42.840
and a few others. Fortunately, Hazy Maze Cave 
has the lake, so Mario is able to accumulate

2:42:42.840,2:42:46.979
some speed, then conserve it into the castle 
lobby with a pause exit while he’s in the water.

2:42:46.979,2:42:52.919
But how much speed does he need? Well, the 
answer is complicated. You see, the goal is

2:42:52.920,2:42:58.080
to reach the ledge of the Secret Aquarium entrance 
without any vertical momentum to help. To do that,

2:42:58.080,2:43:01.620
Mario needs to be moving from a high 
enough platform, but as it turns out,

2:43:01.620,2:43:06.899
this ledge is the highest platform in the entire 
area. The only places high enough to be of any use

2:43:06.899,2:43:11.219
are the 1-up alcove across the room, the alcove 
to the Princess’s Secret Slide, and the hallway

2:43:11.220,2:43:15.780
leading to Bowser in the Dark World. Between 
these, the hallway to Bowser in the Dark World

2:43:15.780,2:43:20.160
is by far the easiest to reach, and everything 
else is too low to attempt a ledge grab from.

2:43:20.160,2:43:25.439
Mario would need a very large amount of speed to 
travel pretty much instantly between those points,

2:43:25.439,2:43:30.120
but it is technically possible. The problem now 
is reaching this point with that amount of speed.

2:43:30.120,2:43:34.559
The only possible way of ascending up to 
the Bowser in the Dark World hallway is to

2:43:34.560,2:43:39.420
go up the central stairs of the lobby. But with 
this much speed, Mario can’t get up the stairs:

2:43:39.420,2:43:43.260
he either gets stuck in place as he’s trying 
to move out of bounds, or he zips through

2:43:43.260,2:43:47.580
and into the hallway to the courtyard. Once 
his speed is low enough to climb the stairs,

2:43:47.580,2:43:54.300
it can’t be brought back up to do the ledge grab. 
This route looked impossible. So, Tyler Kehne and

2:43:54.300,2:44:00.060
Pannenkoek had to think outside the box. Actually, 
not outside the box: outside the universe.

2:44:02.520,2:44:08.100
If you remember, a misalignment is a 1x1 unit 
square on the corner of a platform that exists

2:44:08.100,2:44:12.720
because the floor detection function converts 
Mario’s position from a 32-bit floating point

2:44:12.720,2:44:18.420
number by rounding it down to a 16-bit integer. 
The limitations of 16-bit integers actually

2:44:18.420,2:44:23.160
go both ways: both in precision and in 
scale. We’ve seen this with the water

2:44:23.160,2:44:30.180
level overflow in Wet-Dry World. If you add 
one to an integer’s maximum value of 32767,

2:44:30.180,2:44:36.000
the variable wraps around to its 
lowest possible value, -32768,

2:44:36.000,2:44:40.859
and vice versa. What happened with the water 
level can also happen with Mario’s position.

2:44:40.859,2:44:46.920
But remember, this conversion is only made 
specifically for the floor detection. Mario’s

2:44:46.920,2:44:52.200
actual position always remains a floating point 
number, which can well exceed 32 thousand, up to

2:44:52.200,2:44:57.479
basically infinity. If Mario’s position exceeds 
the integer limit, when it comes to detecting if

2:44:57.479,2:45:02.519
Mario has a floor under him, his position will be 
truncated to a number within the integer limit.

2:45:02.520,2:45:08.040
Essentially, his real position and the floor 
detection position become disjointed. If the

2:45:08.040,2:45:12.720
truncated integer position happens to line up 
with a floor, no matter how far Mario’s actual

2:45:12.720,2:45:17.700
position is, the floor detection function will 
say that yes, Mario is standing on a floor. But

2:45:17.700,2:45:22.080
instead of thinking about it in terms of Mario 
having two different positions simultaneously,

2:45:22.080,2:45:27.120
it’s easier to think of it as there being 
infinite copies of the entire map’s floors 65

2:45:27.120,2:45:31.500
thousand units away in every direction. It 
doesn’t matter that there isn’t an actual

2:45:31.500,2:45:35.280
copy of the floor out there. So long 
as the game believes there is a floor,

2:45:35.280,2:45:38.880
Mario will be able to stand there. 
Functionally, there is no difference.

2:45:38.880,2:45:43.260
These so-called infinite copies of 
the map are named parallel universes,

2:45:43.260,2:45:49.500
or PUs for short. Because only the floor detection 
has this bug, parallel universes have no objects,

2:45:49.500,2:45:55.740
no water, no walls, no textures, only floors 
and ceilings. The typical map size is roughly 16

2:45:55.740,2:46:00.240
thousand units, so only about one sixteenth of 
the total space is filled - everything else is

2:46:00.240,2:46:04.920
considered out of bounds and inaccessible. The 
only way to reach a parallel universe is to have

2:46:04.920,2:46:10.260
so much speed that Mario travels this distance 
instantaneously, in a single frame. Once Mario

2:46:10.260,2:46:14.760
reaches a parallel universe, he must preserve 
this speed, because if he loses it, there’s no

2:46:14.760,2:46:20.220
way to get it back and return to the main map. 
But in fact, just having 65 thousand speed is

2:46:20.220,2:46:25.741
not enough to go to a parallel universe. This is 
because of a quirk of Super Mario 64’s physics.

2:46:26.280,2:46:31.259
When Mario is trying to move, his movement is 
subdivided in four steps called quartersteps.

2:46:31.260,2:46:35.819
For any given frame, the game will check at 
each quarterstep of the way for any obstacles.

2:46:35.819,2:46:41.099
Walls push Mario to the edge of their hitbox and 
allow him to keep moving, but ceilings and out of

2:46:41.100,2:46:46.200
bounds prevent Mario from moving altogether. 
So, if Mario only has enough speed to reach

2:46:46.200,2:46:50.220
the first parallel universe, the game will 
actually check one quarter of the way through

2:46:50.220,2:46:55.620
and only find out of bounds, so he will not be 
moved. For Mario to be able to travel to a PU,

2:46:55.620,2:47:02.399
he needs each quarterstep to be on a valid floor. 
Therefore, he needs four times the speed, or 262

2:47:02.399,2:47:07.620
thousand, and will travel through four PUs 
in a single frame. This is called one QPU.

2:47:07.620,2:47:13.140
Now, if Mario has a speed that 
is an exact multiple of 65536,

2:47:13.140,2:47:17.819
his floor detection position, which we’ll call 
his relative position, stays exactly the same.

2:47:17.819,2:47:22.799
Pannenkoek called this the syncing speed, 
as in the speed where his position syncs up

2:47:22.800,2:47:28.080
with the PUs. By deviating slightly from the 
syncing speed, Mario can travel relatively

2:47:28.080,2:47:33.059
forwards and backwards. By turning ever so 
slightly, he can move relatively sideways,

2:47:33.060,2:47:37.560
but even the tiniest angle changes end 
up greatly magnified over PU distances.

2:47:37.560,2:47:41.760
This is the key to solving the movement 
to the Bowser in the Dark World hallway.

2:47:41.760,2:47:46.620
If Mario achieves PU speed, he can have 
a relative speed that allows him to move

2:47:46.620,2:47:50.880
slowly up the lobby staircase, then wait for 
his speed to go down until it drops low enough

2:47:50.880,2:47:55.500
to travel in the main map, from the hallway 
across to the ledge. But the reality is a bit

2:47:55.500,2:48:00.420
more complicated than that for two reasons. 
First, when Mario is moving with PU speed,

2:48:00.420,2:48:05.640
he is traveling absurd distances. He needs 
to somehow be able to navigate these parallel

2:48:05.640,2:48:09.840
universes in such a way that he is led back 
to the main map at the end. This problem

2:48:09.840,2:48:14.340
can be solved with the right amount of planning, 
which, as it turns out, is a shitton of planning.

2:48:14.340,2:48:20.220
But the second, more concerning problem, is the 
staircase. Well actually, the problem is that this

2:48:20.220,2:48:26.280
is not a staircase. Because of the properties of 
wall hitboxes, this staircase is too steep to be

2:48:26.280,2:48:30.780
a series of individual steps. It would end up as 
a worse version of the staircase to the basement,

2:48:30.780,2:48:35.700
which already has some odd behaviour due to the 
steps being too close to each other. Instead,

2:48:35.700,2:48:39.720
this is a slope, and like all slopes, 
it changes Mario’s de facto speed.

2:48:39.720,2:48:44.460
As a quick refresher, the de facto speed is 
the actual distance that Mario travels, which

2:48:44.460,2:48:49.380
is a factor of the horizontal component of the 
slope he’s currently on. The steeper the slope,

2:48:49.380,2:48:54.780
the lower the de facto speed. Now, when Mario 
steps on the slope with PU speed, his lower de

2:48:54.780,2:48:59.160
facto speed will cause him to attempt to move a 
shorter distance which no longer syncs up with

2:48:59.160,2:49:04.080
a PU and leaves him stuck in place. In other 
words, the syncing speed is not a fixed number:

2:49:04.080,2:49:08.880
it depends on the steepness of the slope that 
Mario is standing on. The steeper the slope,

2:49:08.880,2:49:13.380
the higher the syncing speed needed to 
keep the de facto speed constant. This

2:49:13.380,2:49:19.979
specific slope has a syncing speed of 
381 thousand. So, now, Mario needs 262

2:49:19.979,2:49:25.200
thousand speed to move onto the staircase, then 
381 thousand speed to move up the staircase,

2:49:25.200,2:49:31.559
and back down to 262 thousand to travel to the 
Bowser hallway. Once Mario leaves the hyperspeed

2:49:31.560,2:49:36.780
walking spot, he can no longer gain any more 
speed. Again, we’ve run into a dealbreaker.

2:49:36.780,2:49:39.780
The solution? Simply build up more speed!

2:49:40.380,2:49:45.420
Remember, hyperspeed walking allows Mario 
to speed up slowly, but infinitely. So this

2:49:45.420,2:49:51.000
is what Pannenkoek did. He doubled up the 
initial speed to 524 thousand, so that Mario

2:49:51.000,2:49:56.520
could travel two QPUs per frame instead. After 
conserving that speed into the castle lobby,

2:49:56.520,2:50:01.740
he could reach the staircase, then lower his 
speed down to 381 thousand, go up the slope,

2:50:01.740,2:50:07.139
lower his speed again to 262 thousand, and 
move over to the Bowser hallway. Finally,

2:50:07.140,2:50:11.520
with the right speed, he could snap back to 
reality right at the Secret Aquarium ledge,

2:50:11.520,2:50:17.580
and turn an incredibly simple A press into an 
insane 25-hour marathon. Yes, you heard me right:

2:50:17.580,2:50:24.899
25 hours. Doesn’t matter, though, they saved an 
A press. They saved an A press, right? Right?

2:50:25.920,2:50:31.380
Unfortunately, this strategy, which was obviously 
done on an emulator, was not possible on a real

2:50:31.380,2:50:36.600
Nintendo 64. When Mario travels to a parallel 
universe, the camera tries to follow him,

2:50:36.600,2:50:41.939
which crashes the console every time. Unless 
you use the option to hold R to fix the camera

2:50:41.939,2:50:47.099
in place, in which case it is possible to 
navigate to a PU without crashing. However,

2:50:47.100,2:50:52.439
you can’t fix the camera in the castle interior, 
so even that couldn’t save them. Unlike everything

2:50:52.439,2:50:58.019
that had been done thus far, this strategy could 
not be replicated on an physical Nintendo 64.

2:50:58.020,2:51:03.060
But what about Wii Virtual Console? 
It is an official release, and it is

2:51:03.060,2:51:08.100
an emulator. As it turns out, Wii VC does 
not crash when the camera moves to a PU,

2:51:08.100,2:51:11.580
so this amazing A press save 
could technically live on,

2:51:11.580,2:51:15.420
so long as the challenge was to be done on 
the Wii Virtual Console release of the game,

2:51:15.420,2:51:21.359
not on Nintendo 64. But there’s one little detail 
I told you to keep in mind: spawning displacement,

2:51:21.359,2:51:27.059
used to save a re-entry A press in Tick Tock 
Clock, is a Japanese exclusive glitch. Does

2:51:27.060,2:51:31.859
that mean the optimal A button challenge was now 
limited to the Japanese VC release of the game?

2:51:31.859,2:51:38.519
Surprisingly, no. In 1997, Nintendo released an 
updated Japanese version of the game with Rumble

2:51:38.520,2:51:42.960
Pak support called the Shindou version, where 
Backwards Long Jumping was famously patched

2:51:42.960,2:51:50.100
and Mario’s voice ruined. This version also has 
all of the North American and PAL version fixes,

2:51:50.100,2:51:56.279
including spawning displacement. The Japanese 
VC release is the Shindou version. Since no VC

2:51:56.279,2:52:01.259
release can do spawning displacement, switching 
to VC to save an A press lost the Tick Tock Clock

2:52:01.260,2:52:06.540
re-entry A press save, ultimately resulting 
in no improvement. Therefore, despite this

2:52:06.540,2:52:10.740
technically constituting an A press save, it 
did not end up lowering the A press count.

2:52:11.580,2:52:15.899
In the meantime, Pannenkoek’s YouTube channel 
was starting to garner a lot of attention.

2:52:15.899,2:52:21.059
His most popular content wasn’t the A Button 
Challenge, but unrelated, usually commentated

2:52:21.060,2:52:24.960
videos about interesting discoveries, like 
collecting the fabled impossible coin,

2:52:24.960,2:52:29.340
or exploring the secrets of the Mystery 
Goomba. He began to cement his place in

2:52:29.340,2:52:33.840
the YouTube sphere as an expert Super 
Mario 64 scientist. But nothing he had

2:52:33.840,2:52:38.100
published before got as much press and public 
attention than the Tick Tock Clock Upwarp.

2:52:38.100,2:52:44.100
The story goes like this: Kyman had stumbled upon 
an old Twitch video from 2013 of a speedrunner

2:52:44.100,2:52:49.380
named DOTA_Teabag, who saw Mario inexplicably 
warp significantly upwards in Tick Tock Clock.

2:52:49.380,2:52:54.300
This was potentially groundbreaking because 
an upwarp of this magnitude that seemingly

2:52:54.300,2:52:58.080
didn’t require the A button could reshape 
the future of the A Button Challenge,

2:52:58.080,2:53:03.899
particularly in Tick Tock Clock of all places. 
The potential was so huge that Pannen decided

2:53:03.899,2:53:07.799
to put a 1000 dollar bounty for whoever 
could replicate the glitch in an emulator

2:53:07.800,2:53:11.700
and provide an input file that could be 
analyzed to make sense of this anomaly.

2:53:11.700,2:53:17.160
Money speaks, and so thousands of people, for the 
most part completely inexperienced, haphazardly

2:53:17.160,2:53:21.960
smashed their face against the wall hoping for the 
golden ticket to the top of the clock. There was

2:53:21.960,2:53:26.760
little information to go by other than a somewhat 
mediocre quality video, but with such a revolution

2:53:26.760,2:53:32.340
right around the corner, the collective motivation 
to crack the mystery was enormous. Countless news

2:53:32.340,2:53:38.580
articles were written about it. Even as recently 
as 2021, Derek Muller from Veritasium covered the

2:53:38.580,2:53:44.340
subject in a video with over 17 million views. 
But as time went on, with no one managing to

2:53:44.340,2:53:49.560
get anywhere close to replicating it, the ABC crew 
realized that there had to be another explanation.

2:53:49.560,2:53:54.660
Years after the fact, the commonly accepted 
explanation is a hardware malfunction causing

2:53:54.660,2:53:58.979
a bitflip at Mario’s vertical position. 
Flipping a specific bit in the position

2:53:58.979,2:54:03.599
in similar conditions achieves just about the 
exact same result as was observed back then.

2:54:03.600,2:54:08.880
The popular explanation is a cosmic ray, but the 
exact cause behind the bitflip is impossible to

2:54:08.880,2:54:13.859
know for sure. As promising as it initially 
looked, this discovery ended up shelved as

2:54:13.859,2:54:17.639
a one-off hardware issue that could not be 
used in speedruns or the A Button Challenge.

2:54:18.359,2:54:22.979
Nonetheless, there was still one Tick Tock Clock 
discovery that ended up crucial for the challenge:

2:54:22.979,2:54:29.399
the Pedro spot. Originally found in Cool, Cool 
Mountain by Pedro Viktor in November 2014, a

2:54:29.399,2:54:34.920
Pedro spot is a point where a floor and a ceiling 
meet in a very specific way. When Mario lands onto

2:54:34.920,2:54:39.180
a Pedro spot, he would snap up to the floor, 
but that point is inside the ceiling hitbox,

2:54:39.180,2:54:43.979
which prevents him from moving. The landing action 
happens before the collision with the ceiling,

2:54:43.979,2:54:49.019
so Mario doesn’t bonk on it. But since Mario 
is prevented from moving, he stays suspended

2:54:49.020,2:54:54.300
in midair. From this odd double state, he 
can both jump and ground pound. But also,

2:54:54.300,2:55:00.000
he can build up forwards speed without moving, 
similarly to hyperspeed walking. This is limited

2:55:00.000,2:55:04.260
by the geometry around him: at high enough 
speeds, he ends up breaking out of the spot.

2:55:04.800,2:55:09.779
With no ability to turn or otherwise redirect 
Mario’s speed, Pedro spots are a bit limited

2:55:09.779,2:55:14.279
in what they can achieve. But when Tyler Kehne 
found a Pedro spot here, in Tick Tock Clock,

2:55:14.279,2:55:19.380
he realized it had excellent potential to bring 
Stomp on the Thwomp’s 7 A presses down. Mario

2:55:19.380,2:55:24.779
couldn’t get in position by himself: he needed 
a bob-omb to push him in place. The clock also

2:55:24.779,2:55:28.740
had to be on the still setting, which meant that 
the spinners typically used to travel up the clock

2:55:28.740,2:55:34.439
with a bob-omb in 0 A presses could not be used. 
Instead, four A presses were required to jump up,

2:55:34.439,2:55:38.519
and instant release was used to place the 
bob-omb out of bounds to be reactivated near

2:55:38.520,2:55:44.460
the cogs. At first glance, that seems terrible. 
But what comes next more than makes up for it.

2:55:44.460,2:55:50.700
Mario uses the bob-omb to push himself into the 
Pedro spot. Once he builds up over 800 speed,

2:55:50.700,2:55:57.120
he’s ready to do a jump dive. Again, with so much 
speed, he jumps extremely high, but the dive caps

2:55:57.120,2:56:02.220
his speed at 48 instantly. That’s enough to get 
all the way up to the top of the clock, where

2:56:02.220,2:56:07.380
one final A press gets him the star and brings 
Stomp on the Thwomp from 7 down to 6 A presses.

2:56:07.979,2:56:11.339
In response to the ever increasing 
interest for his commentated videos,

2:56:11.340,2:56:15.359
Pannenkoek decided that A Button Challenge 
improvements should have accompanying

2:56:15.359,2:56:19.620
explanations with voice commentary, so 
he made one for Stomp on the Thwomp. He

2:56:19.620,2:56:23.399
carefully broke down every element of the 
strategy for casual viewers to understand:

2:56:23.399,2:56:27.479
the HOLP, instant release, the out 
of bounds failsafe, the Pedro spot,

2:56:27.479,2:56:33.059
and the high speed jump dive. It was received with 
high praise and excitement by his growing fanbase.

2:56:34.080,2:56:39.000
In June 2015, Pannenkoek was exploring 
scuttlebug transportation and trying to

2:56:39.000,2:56:43.319
get a scuttlebug to go through a door. 
His attempt proved mildly successful:

2:56:43.319,2:56:47.340
he was able to get one scuttlebug to clip 
through a door, but then it was stuck next to

2:56:47.340,2:56:51.359
the door and would deactivate as soon as Mario 
stepped away. While playing around with this,

2:56:51.359,2:56:54.420
Pannen found that he could get the 
scuttlebug to jump up repeatedly

2:56:54.420,2:56:59.819
by running in and out of its activation 
zone. He had discovered scuttlebug raising.

2:56:59.819,2:57:03.899
The way this works is similar to the 
mechanics abused for the Chuckya drop and

2:57:03.899,2:57:08.639
Fly Guy manipulation. In levels with multiple 
rooms, the inside of a room is only loaded

2:57:08.640,2:57:12.840
when Mario is in it, or when he’s standing 
close to the door leading to it. Therefore,

2:57:12.840,2:57:17.220
a scuttlebug in one room gets deactivated 
as soon as Mario steps away from the door

2:57:17.220,2:57:21.359
outside of that room. This was used 
before in Metal Head Mario can Move!

2:57:21.359,2:57:26.939
Similarly to the Fly Guy and Chuckya, a scuttlebug 
also has a limited range of actions when it’s

2:57:26.939,2:57:31.559
deactivated. Although it won’t move, it can 
still turn and lunge at Mario if he enters

2:57:31.560,2:57:37.200
the radius around its home. Once the scuttlebug 
is reactivated, it will perform that lunge. If

2:57:37.200,2:57:41.880
Mario deactivates the scuttlebug in the middle 
of the lunge, it will stay in midair. Then,

2:57:41.880,2:57:46.020
another lunge can be triggered, and the 
scuttlebug can jump again when reactivated.

2:57:46.020,2:57:51.180
This process can be repeated indefinitely, and 
the scuttlebug can jump up arbitrarily high.

2:57:51.180,2:57:55.800
This development seems relatively 
insignificant. It’s anything but

2:57:55.800,2:58:00.899
that. The final piece of the puzzle 
was in place. The last Hazy Maze Cave

2:58:00.899,2:58:07.139
A press was ready to be taken off. Watch for 
Rolling Rocks in 0.5 A Presses was possible.

2:58:08.160,2:58:13.260
The entire route is a culmination of every 
discovery made in the past year. First,

2:58:13.260,2:58:17.880
scuttlebug transportation was used to move the 
scuttlebug below the platform where the star

2:58:17.880,2:58:23.640
is. Then, scuttlebug raising was used to make it 
jump up. The exact position of the scuttlebug’s

2:58:23.640,2:58:28.439
home is crucial here: the cylinder around its home 
partially intersects with the area near the door

2:58:28.439,2:58:33.240
where the scuttlebug is activated. Mario can enter 
the radius without activating the scuttlebug,

2:58:33.240,2:58:37.319
which triggers a delayed lunge. Then, 
as Mario steps out of the home cylinder,

2:58:37.319,2:58:42.660
the scuttlebug turns back towards its home. When 
Mario reactivates the scuttlebug, it lunges past

2:58:42.660,2:58:47.340
its home. When the process is repeated, the 
scuttlebug now turns the other way to jump back

2:58:47.340,2:58:51.779
towards its home. As it jumps back and forth, 
the result is it moving straight up over time.

2:58:52.380,2:58:57.240
Once the scuttlebug is in the correct position, 
Pannenkoek moves on to the next part of the plan.

2:58:57.240,2:59:02.279
He goes to the lake and builds up speed with 
hyperspeed walking, making sure to redirect it out

2:59:02.279,2:59:09.300
of bounds. He builds up speed for 12 hours, until 
he has 479 thousand. Using the properties of de

2:59:09.300,2:59:14.520
facto speed, he’s able to navigate up the path to 
the elevator using floor triangles with decreasing

2:59:14.520,2:59:19.800
steepnesses so that the syncing speed gradually 
comes down over time. Remember: objects aren’t

2:59:19.800,2:59:24.359
present in parallel universes, so Mario needs 
to return to the main map to board the elevator.

2:59:24.359,2:59:29.580
This was made complicated by QPU alignment: 
in short, while Mario has enough speed

2:59:29.580,2:59:34.620
to travel four PUs in one frame, he doesn’t 
necessarily complete all four quartersteps of his

2:59:34.620,2:59:40.680
movement action. Mario only moves up to the last 
valid quarterstep in a frame. If a quarterstep

2:59:40.680,2:59:45.180
leads him out of bounds because the slope changed 
or because he’s not quite at the syncing speed,

2:59:45.180,2:59:50.753
he can end up moving by a fraction of his total 
speed. Doing so misaligns him with regular full

2:59:50.753,2:59:55.679
frame movements and he has to do another partial 
movement to get back to the main map. The PU

2:59:55.680,3:00:00.180
navigation had to be painstakingly planned 
out so that everything would line up in the

3:00:00.180,3:00:05.279
end. Just like last time, Mario uses repeated 
kicks to activate and to stay on the elevator.

3:00:05.279,3:00:10.080
Once he reaches the height of the next 
elevator, Mario quickly travels to a PU

3:00:10.080,3:00:15.180
and back to effectively warp across the map. This 
second elevator takes him up to the highest point

3:00:15.180,3:00:20.399
he can reach. Pannenkoek sets up his position 
in parallel universes in preparation for the

3:00:20.399,3:00:25.139
final move, and then, he returns to the main map 
on the scuttlebug that he previously positioned

3:00:25.140,3:00:30.060
so that he can bounce on it. This actually still 
isn’t enough to reach the platform, so he places

3:00:30.060,3:00:34.920
himself in a unit-precise spot and ground pounds 
into a misalignment at the corner of the platform.

3:00:34.920,3:00:40.980
And this is Watch for Rolling Rocks in 0.5 A 
presses, the final A press in Hazy Maze Cave gone.

3:00:42.240,3:00:46.380
As soon as Pannenkoek pieced everything together 
for this A press save, he knew that it had

3:00:46.380,3:00:51.779
incredible potential for a detailed explanation 
with commentary and visuals. However, college was

3:00:51.779,3:00:55.740
taking up his time, and so, despite figuring 
out all the steps to do the star in October,

3:00:55.740,3:00:59.700
he didn’t actually work on the project 
until the holidays. When Christmas came,

3:00:59.700,3:01:04.200
he realized that while planning and TASing such 
a complex star already was a time-consuming

3:01:04.200,3:01:08.519
and energy draining process, creating this 
behemoth of a video explanation turned out

3:01:08.520,3:01:12.960
to be even more taxing. But the project 
had already been shelved for two months,

3:01:12.960,3:01:16.260
so with college starting again in 
two weeks, he decided to press on.

3:01:16.260,3:01:23.640
He pressed on. He had to get it done. He worked 
tirelessly, day in, day out. But in the end,

3:01:23.640,3:01:31.859
he pressed himself too hard. Pannenkoek was 
in a terrible mental space. He was struggling

3:01:31.859,3:01:35.700
through issues in his personal life, and 
working on this video was not an escape:

3:01:35.700,3:01:40.500
it was a purgatory. In the end, what should 
have been a passion project turned out

3:01:40.500,3:01:45.479
to be the canalization of his own mental 
suffering. He completed the entire TAS and

3:01:45.479,3:01:51.540
the accompanying video in about 140 hours over 
two short weeks. He should have been immensely

3:01:51.540,3:01:57.240
proud of his work. He didn’t feel pride. He 
didn’t feel accomplished. He felt nothing.

3:01:58.200,3:02:03.599
Pannen was used to his videos going viral, but 
nothing could prepare him for what would become

3:02:03.600,3:02:09.120
of Watch for Rolling Rocks. As it went viral, 
it instantly exposed the A Button Challenge to

3:02:09.120,3:02:14.519
hundreds of thousands of people for the first time 
in their lives. These viewers’ first impression of

3:02:14.520,3:02:20.399
the A Button Challenge was this. The incredibly 
thorough 24-minute piece was approachable, yet

3:02:20.399,3:02:26.399
utterly unbelievable. It was so many levels beyond 
what anything these people had ever seen that they

3:02:26.399,3:02:32.099
couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of it 
all. Scuttlebug transportation. Half A presses.

3:02:32.100,3:02:39.300
Building speed for 12 hours. Parallel universes. 
QPU alignment. Every single concept of the video

3:02:39.300,3:02:44.940
seemed like made up nonsense in some over-the-top 
absurdist humor. Yet all of it was real.

3:02:45.899,3:02:50.279
Watch for Rolling Rocks in 0.5 A 
presses rapidly became not just a meme,

3:02:50.279,3:02:54.059
but a family of memes that played on 
the chasm between casual gameplay and

3:02:54.060,3:02:59.040
top-level speedruns or tool-assisted runs. 
The ABC crew members were not just geniuses,

3:02:59.040,3:03:04.500
they were the gods of Super Mario 64. To this 
day, the video has over 4 million views and

3:03:04.500,3:03:08.460
the memes that stemmed from it made their way 
into unexpectedly far reaches of the Internet.

3:03:09.300,3:03:13.439
Meanwhile, Pannenkoek spent the winter 
semester mentally recovering from his

3:03:13.439,3:03:18.120
breakdown during the holidays. Part of that 
recovery process was establishing that the

3:03:18.120,3:03:21.300
pressure he was putting on himself to 
always improve the production value

3:03:21.300,3:03:26.160
of his channel was destructive. He realized 
that this mindset would ultimately lead him

3:03:26.160,3:03:30.180
into a spiral of ever increasing workloads 
until nothing would ever get done again.

3:03:30.180,3:03:35.640
With the unprecedented success of the latest ABC 
video, public pressure on him to keep creating

3:03:35.640,3:03:41.279
similar content was mounting. Memes about half A 
presses and scuttlebug jamborees were parroted in

3:03:41.279,3:03:46.080
every comment section of not just his videos, 
but pretty much every Super Mario 64 video out

3:03:46.080,3:03:50.640
there. Pannenkoek was being reminded of the 
video and its nightmarish production cycle

3:03:50.640,3:03:56.040
at just about every corner. His mental scars 
were still fresh, so he knew there was no way

3:03:56.040,3:03:59.939
he would make anything of the scale of Watch 
for Rolling Rocks until he would actually feel

3:03:59.939,3:04:04.379
ready to undertake the project. It’s widely 
believed that the memes were the reason

3:04:04.380,3:04:09.120
Pannenkoek quit making commentated videos, but 
they actually were a tiny factor in the equation.

3:04:09.660,3:04:14.279
The main reason behind it is quite simply that 
he doesn’t enjoy making voice commentary, and

3:04:14.279,3:04:18.599
making such videos represented too much tedious 
work unless they were exceptionally worth it.

3:04:18.600,3:04:23.700
So, after releasing that video, he decided 
to switch his mindset. A Button Challenge

3:04:23.700,3:04:27.899
videos would go on his secondary channel, 
which he renamed UncommentatedPannen,

3:04:27.899,3:04:32.219
and where he felt zero pressure to make 
high-effort content. The first step was

3:04:32.220,3:04:36.240
to release a bunch of ABC improvements he 
had been holding onto since the discovery

3:04:36.240,3:04:39.899
of scuttlebug raising in October, until 
he could get around to making commentated

3:04:39.899,3:04:45.120
explanations. So, on January 13th, 2016, 
he dumped five improvements at once,

3:04:45.120,3:04:48.960
then went relatively inactive in the A Button 
Challenge for the better part of the year,

3:04:48.960,3:04:53.279
instead focusing on glitch documentation and 
explanation videos on his secondary channel.

3:04:54.420,3:04:59.760
Every improvement from Pannen’s backlog stemmed 
from the discovery of scuttlebug raising. It

3:04:59.760,3:05:04.380
helped eliminate the half A press left in the two 
other Hazy Maze Cave stars that used hyperspeed

3:05:04.380,3:05:09.840
and elevators. First, A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit, 
solved by raising a scuttlebug for half an hour

3:05:09.840,3:05:13.920
until it would jump into the right spot for 
Mario to bounce across to the star, and second,

3:05:13.920,3:05:15.100
the red coin star. For this one, Pannen needed 
to get the scuttlebug from the red coins room

3:05:15.100,3:05:19.439
high up in the air. He could manipulate it from 
the first room, but only if the scuttlebug was in

3:05:19.439,3:05:24.179
the perfect position. To get it in the perfect 
spot, he had to go down in the red coins room.

3:05:24.180,3:05:29.279
To go back to the first room, he needed to 
cross this gap in no A presses. Thankfully,

3:05:29.279,3:05:33.599
two scuttlebugs could be transported over and 
Mario could bounce on them both to go back to

3:05:33.600,3:05:38.460
the red coins room. From there, just one hour 
of scuttlebug raising was sufficient to have

3:05:38.460,3:05:42.359
the scuttlebug fall on Mario to dismount 
the pole, saving another half A press.

3:05:42.359,3:05:47.460
The other applications of scuttlebug raising 
were in Big Boo’s Haunt, and they were a bit

3:05:47.460,3:05:51.779
more involved. Here, one A press was left 
to grab the star in the Merry-go-Round,

3:05:51.779,3:05:55.979
and one was required to reach the top 
floor of the mansion for both Big Boo’s

3:05:55.979,3:06:00.540
Balcony and Eye-to-Eye in the Secret Room. 
Let’s start with Big Boo’s Merry-go-Round.

3:06:00.540,3:06:05.340
Pannen got a scuttlebug into a specific spot 
against the side of the mansion with scuttlebug

3:06:05.340,3:06:10.080
transportation. Then, by alternating between going 
near the scuttlebug to get it to turn around,

3:06:10.080,3:06:15.540
and activating it by standing by the front door, 
Pannen was able to raise the scuttlebug. How much

3:06:15.540,3:06:21.720
does he raise it, do you ask? Well, only about 
ten times - sorry - ten hours. After ten hours,

3:06:21.720,3:06:25.800
the scuttlebug is so high up that it has 
entered a vertical parallel universe.

3:06:25.800,3:06:31.439
Vertical parallel universes, or VPUs for short, 
function slightly differently than regular

3:06:31.439,3:06:36.660
PUs do. Here, it’s the vertical position that 
overflows rather than the horizontal position.

3:06:36.660,3:06:41.099
The result is different for Mario than it is 
for enemies, so let’s look at what happens

3:06:41.100,3:06:46.319
specifically to the scuttlebug when it reaches 
a VPU. When the position initially overflows,

3:06:46.319,3:06:49.679
the scuttlebug’s floor detection 
doesn’t find any floor under itself,

3:06:49.680,3:06:54.359
so its behaviour becomes a big more erratic. 
Instead of turning towards Mario, it spins in

3:06:54.359,3:07:00.719
place. Pannen can still keep raising it just fine 
despite that limitation. Once it gets even higher,

3:07:00.720,3:07:06.000
it reaches the mansion relatively in the VPU, 
but floors and ceilings are not solid. So,

3:07:06.000,3:07:11.460
it can keep raising through and above the virtual 
map. Once it’s high enough, Pannen reactivates the

3:07:11.460,3:07:16.560
scuttlebug and it jumps down. Again, because 
floors and ceilings are not solid in VPUs,

3:07:16.560,3:07:20.880
the scuttlebug goes through the level and into 
the basement, where it collides with the wall.

3:07:20.880,3:07:27.300
Contrarily to regular PUs, VPUs do have solid 
walls, and they have a peculiar property: when

3:07:27.300,3:07:31.320
the scuttlebug collides with the wall, it gets 
snapped to the wall’s height, in the main map.

3:07:31.859,3:07:36.660
To summarize, the scuttlebug is raised for 
10 hours until it enters a vertical parallel

3:07:36.660,3:07:41.160
universe so it can fall through the floor and 
reach a position relative to the merry-go-round in

3:07:41.160,3:07:46.319
the basement. Then, it collides with a wall that 
snaps it back to the main map. At the same time,

3:07:46.319,3:07:51.660
Mario leaves the scuttlebug’s activation range, 
so it stops moving there. When Mario enters the

3:07:51.660,3:07:56.340
Merry-go-round, the scuttlebug remains deactivated 
because it’s hardcoded to belong to the outside

3:07:56.340,3:08:01.620
of the mansion, no matter where it actually 
is. Despite being deactivated and invisible,

3:08:01.620,3:08:05.460
the scuttlebug is still tangible, so 
Mario can bounce on it and reach the star.

3:08:06.000,3:08:10.979
The other application of scuttlebug raising was 
to reach the highest floor of the mansion. The

3:08:10.979,3:08:14.819
idea is quite similar, but instead, three 
different scuttlebugs are moved to roughly

3:08:14.819,3:08:21.240
the same location and simultaneously raised for 
13 hours into a VPU. After reactivating them,

3:08:21.240,3:08:25.439
Pannenkoek precisely guides them into the room 
leading to the top floor, where they collide

3:08:25.439,3:08:30.179
with a wall that snaps them back to the main map. 
After a little bit of additional manipulation,

3:08:30.180,3:08:35.819
he’s able to stagger them in a staircase leading 
to the upper ledge. Again, because the scuttlebugs

3:08:35.819,3:08:39.779
belong to the exterior, when he goes near 
them, they are invisible and stuck in mid-air,

3:08:39.779,3:08:44.759
but they are still tangible. Instead of 
a sideflip and two bookends, Pannenkoek

3:08:44.760,3:08:49.500
uses one bookend to get up on this step, then the 
other bookend and the three carefully positioned

3:08:49.500,3:08:54.120
scuttlebugs to reach the top floor and save 
the two final A presses in Big Boo’s Haunt.

3:08:54.720,3:09:00.300
During 2016, despite the relative inactivity of 
the ABC crew, thanks to the universal acclaim

3:09:00.300,3:09:04.080
of Watch for Rolling Rocks, the A Button 
Challenge saw a large influx of fans eager

3:09:04.080,3:09:09.720
to contribute to new strategy developments. The 
crew grew larger and larger. But so much work

3:09:09.720,3:09:13.620
had already been done that it would take 
a long time for newcomers to start making

3:09:13.620,3:09:19.080
any meaningful progress. Or maybe all it took 
was just to look at a star with a fresh pair

3:09:19.080,3:09:23.460
of eyes. I’ve left the best improvement 
for last: Wing Mario over the Rainbow.

3:09:24.240,3:09:29.519
This star was famously used by Pannenkoek as an 
example to demonstrate the half A press notation.

3:09:29.520,3:09:34.439
Two A presses were very clearly needed to shoot 
the cannon twice in order to get all the red

3:09:34.439,3:09:39.059
coins, but in order to reach the first cannon, a 
half A press was also required so that Mario would

3:09:39.060,3:09:45.600
fall down slower to the cannon platform. Until 
Super Mario 64 expert sm64expert found this.

3:09:46.800,3:09:52.500
Yep, that’s it. Instead of just running up, 
if you do a dive recover before the slidekick,

3:09:52.500,3:09:55.260
you have just enough speed to 
make it without the slower fall.

3:09:56.460,3:10:00.840
Near the end of 2016, what used to be just 
a small group of friends calling themselves

3:10:00.840,3:10:06.420
the ABC crew was now a full blown community. 
Millions of people had heard of the A Button

3:10:06.420,3:10:12.120
Challenge. Pannenkoek was a superstar. Tens of 
thousands were following developments closely,

3:10:12.120,3:10:17.399
celebrating each new upload, even if it was all 
on his secondary channel by then. But soon enough,

3:10:17.399,3:10:22.799
the wave of newcomers realized something: 
the task at hand was monumental. The A Press

3:10:22.800,3:10:27.479
count was now at 32. Exactly half of 
those were for Tick Tock Clock alone,

3:10:27.479,3:10:32.580
and the other half for the rest of the entire 
game. This was the dawn of the Modern Era.

3:10:32.580,3:10:37.319
An era defined by the seemingly hopeless 
uphill battle of solving Tick Tock Clock.

3:10:38.700,3:10:50.099
Pannenkoek was still in a period of relative 
inactivity. Despite some developments being

3:10:50.100,3:10:54.479
made in 2016, nothing was released until 
November, when he put out a pair of

3:10:54.479,3:10:59.580
improvements that had been discovered months 
prior. The first one was in Jolly Roger Bay.

3:11:00.180,3:11:05.640
The side wall of the ship is actually not always 
a wall. This is because the status of floor,

3:11:05.640,3:11:11.460
wall or ceiling is not an inherent property of 
a given triangle. It depends on its orientation.

3:11:11.460,3:11:17.460
A triangle that is facing generally upwards is a 
floor, one that is facing downwards is a ceiling,

3:11:17.460,3:11:21.359
and any triangle facing sideways 
is a wall. But as it turns out,

3:11:21.359,3:11:26.460
for a triangle to be treated as a wall, it 
needs to be nearly perfectly vertical. As

3:11:26.460,3:11:30.120
soon as it tilts just a little bit, 
it becomes a floor or a ceiling.

3:11:30.120,3:11:35.220
As the ship sways to one side, this wall 
temporarily becomes a floor for just long

3:11:35.220,3:11:40.859
enough that Mario can framewalk up. It was 
refreshing for the ABC crew to stumble upon

3:11:40.859,3:11:45.839
a relatively simple A press save. Little did 
they know that this would be the final one.

3:11:47.700,3:11:53.220
The other development came in Tick Tock Clock. 
While in the past, the ABC had done its fair

3:11:53.220,3:11:58.380
share of RNG manipulation when dealing with 
Chuckya, goombas and moving coins, these baby

3:11:58.380,3:12:04.319
steps paled in comparison to the most advanced 
form of RNG abuse yet: pendulum manipulation.

3:12:04.319,3:12:10.019
On the random setting, the clock’s moving parts 
rely heavily on the RNG value to determine

3:12:10.020,3:12:15.180
their pattern. The pendulum is one of them. 
However, its behaviour is pretty barebones:

3:12:15.180,3:12:19.620
at the end of each swing, it calls the 
RNG function. Two thirds of the time,

3:12:19.620,3:12:25.500
it swings slowly. One third of the time, it swings 
faster. The pendulum accelerates until its angle

3:12:25.500,3:12:29.880
goes beyond zero, at which point it slows down 
at the same speed, ending up at roughly the

3:12:29.880,3:12:34.800
same angle on the other side. No matter if it 
swings fast or slow, this fact doesn’t change:

3:12:34.800,3:12:41.040
the pendulum always has the same, somewhat narrow 
range of motion. Until something strange happens.

3:12:41.040,3:12:47.279
Because the pendulum accelerates until its angle 
goes beyond zero, if it somehow passes directly

3:12:47.279,3:12:52.259
at zero, it will accelerate on that frame 
and start slowing down on the next. However,

3:12:52.260,3:12:56.880
when it comes back the other way, if it passes 
at zero again, it will also keep accelerating

3:12:56.880,3:13:02.340
for one more frame. Effectively, if the pendulum 
is on either side, it will experience a force

3:13:02.340,3:13:06.359
pulling towards the center. But if it’s 
exactly in the center, it will experience

3:13:06.359,3:13:10.979
a force in the same direction as its movement, 
resulting in a net increase in total energy.

3:13:10.979,3:13:16.679
The pendulum’s range of motion therefore keeps 
increasing for each swing passing through zero.

3:13:16.680,3:13:21.779
Now, two questions remain: how does the pendulum 
suddenly start passing through angle zero,

3:13:21.779,3:13:26.399
and how can it keep passing through angle 
zero repeatedly? Well, those are really just

3:13:26.399,3:13:31.139
the same question: how can we manipulate 
the pendulum to do exactly what we want?

3:13:31.140,3:13:36.420
When the pendulum chooses a fast or a slow 
swing, the option it chooses slightly changes

3:13:36.420,3:13:40.140
where it will cross the middle point, and 
therefore where it will stop on the other

3:13:40.140,3:13:45.000
side. If the acceleration was a fixed value, 
like on the slow, fast and still settings,

3:13:45.000,3:13:50.460
the pendulum would always swing between the same 
two points. In fact, whenever the random pendulum

3:13:50.460,3:13:56.040
chooses the same speed twice in a row, it returns 
precisely to the same point after two swings. But

3:13:56.040,3:14:00.300
if it chooses a different speed on every swing, 
the slight variation in where it crosses the

3:14:00.300,3:14:05.880
middle point causes the pendulum to never quite 
return to the same position every time. Similarly,

3:14:05.880,3:14:10.740
the point where the pendulum crosses the center 
slightly oscilates around the middle. All that’s

3:14:10.740,3:14:16.080
left is to keep alternating speeds until the 
pendulum happens to line up exactly at angle zero.

3:14:16.080,3:14:22.740
It takes 291 swings to get there. Once it gets 
there, what you want is the opposite. Now,

3:14:22.740,3:14:27.000
you want the pendulum to keep crossing 
angle zero on every swing. So,

3:14:27.000,3:14:31.140
the pendulum has to choose the same speed 
on every swing to keep gaining momentum.

3:14:31.140,3:14:37.439
The actual manipulation part is pretty simple, 
if only a bit tedious. The RNG function is a

3:14:37.439,3:14:44.040
complex operation that basically takes a 
number from 0 to 65535 and spits out a new,

3:14:44.040,3:14:48.960
seemingly unrelated number. It iterates upon 
itself, which means that the output from one

3:14:48.960,3:14:54.479
call becomes the input for the next call. A given 
input always yields the same output: for example,

3:14:54.479,3:15:03.839
2044 always yields 129, which always returns 
15937, and so on. Therefore, the RNG function

3:15:03.840,3:15:08.939
is a closed loop: once an output is the same 
as a previous input, the loop is closed and the

3:15:08.939,3:15:16.080
values cycle in the same exact order. The full 
loop starts at 0 and contains 65114 numbers.

3:15:16.080,3:15:21.420
Every time the function is called, the value 
advances one step through the loop. This can

3:15:21.420,3:15:25.260
happen multiple times in a single frame, 
depending on how many objects are calling

3:15:25.260,3:15:31.020
RNG at any given time. Thankfully, there’s one 
simple way for Mario to call RNG on demand:

3:15:31.020,3:15:36.720
kicking up dust. To determine their exact 
position, dust clouds call the RNG function.

3:15:36.720,3:15:42.060
Therefore, by choosing to generate dust, 
Mario has direct control over the RNG to

3:15:42.060,3:15:46.319
a certain degree. Because the pendulum only 
calls the function at the end of each swing,

3:15:46.319,3:15:50.160
there’s plenty of time in-between to 
manipulate RNG to a desired value.

3:15:50.160,3:15:55.319
This is what Pannenkoek does. Once up on 
this platform, he kicks up dust to get

3:15:55.319,3:16:00.599
the pendulum to cycle through the 291 swings 
until it crosses angle 0 and starts gaining

3:16:00.600,3:16:05.760
momentum. Now that pendulum manipulation is 
in full swing, the pendulum’s range of motion

3:16:05.760,3:16:10.080
keeps increasing until it swings through 
the ceiling and onto the next floor. Then,

3:16:10.080,3:16:15.540
Mario rides that swinging pendulum up and brings 
down Timed Jumps on Moving Bars from 4 down to 3

3:16:15.540,3:16:21.300
A presses. Unfortunately, pendulum manipulation 
ended up only being useful in this spot, since

3:16:21.300,3:16:25.920
other pendulums couldn’t provide any meaningful 
help from swinging outside of their usual range.

3:16:26.939,3:16:31.679
In June 2016, a TASer by the name 
of Z1mb0bw4y posted a comment on

3:16:31.680,3:16:36.120
Pannenkoek’s video about The Pit and 
the Pendulums in 2 A presses. She said:

3:16:36.120,3:16:40.559
“Can this be done on the random setting? 
It’s possible to do a kick off the wall while

3:16:40.560,3:16:45.359
grabbing the star and fall all the way down to 
the red coin platforms. I think this could save

3:16:45.359,3:16:50.880
an A press.” That comment got lost in the sea 
of empty claims Pannen was subject to all the

3:16:50.880,3:16:55.560
time. He couldn’t replicate what this comment 
was talking about, so he dismissed the idea,

3:16:55.560,3:17:01.200
just like the hundreds of other empty claims that 
came before and since. It took until November for

3:17:01.200,3:17:06.660
Plush to look into the matter. But when he did, 
he found out that Z1mb0bw4y was absolutely right.

3:17:06.660,3:17:11.639
She had found a way to save one more A press, 
using a trick called kick recoil momentum.

3:17:12.479,3:17:16.799
Thanks to a convenient pendulum, Mario is 
able to kick the wall and pick up the star

3:17:16.800,3:17:22.680
simultaneously. Normally, picking up a star zeroes 
out Mario’s horizontal speed, but kicking the wall

3:17:22.680,3:17:27.359
gives him a lot of backwards momentum. He then 
falls down with the star with that momentum,

3:17:27.359,3:17:31.920
which is just barely enough to reach the lowest 
spinner and end the stage on a rotating platform.

3:17:31.920,3:17:37.020
Spawning displacement does the rest of the work 
and a second Tick Tock Clock re-entry A press

3:17:37.020,3:17:42.660
was saved. This also broke the tie between the 
Japanese Nintendo 64 version and the VC version,

3:17:42.660,3:17:47.220
returning the original release to the spot of 
single best version for the A button challenge.

3:17:47.939,3:17:53.160
2017 was a transitional year. Even though 
the community was bubbling with activity,

3:17:53.160,3:17:58.019
the actual challenge itself had its 
most quiet year since 2012. Instead,

3:17:58.020,3:18:02.640
people were busy learning more about the 
game and developing new tools. Specifically,

3:18:02.640,3:18:06.420
danebou and pannenkoek, along with 
a few occasional other contributors,

3:18:06.420,3:18:12.359
created the Super Mario 64 Technical Runtime 
Observer and Object Processor: STROOP.

3:18:12.359,3:18:18.540
STROOP is basically RAM watch on steroids. It 
runs alongside the emulator and keeps track of

3:18:18.540,3:18:23.580
every useful piece of memory. It also has 
the ability to hack in arbitrary values,

3:18:23.580,3:18:29.160
and every way of visualizing data under the sun. 
It took years of shaping up to make STROOP such

3:18:29.160,3:18:34.139
a robust and versatile tool, but the result is 
worth the investment. From this point onwards,

3:18:34.140,3:18:39.420
the Super Mario 64 TASing community as a whole 
benefited from the incredible work of danebou,

3:18:39.420,3:18:43.140
pannenkoek and everyone else who worked 
on STROOP. So, by the end of the year,

3:18:43.140,3:18:47.880
the ABC community was fully ready to 
tackle the remaining 28 A presses.

3:18:47.880,3:18:54.060
I say 28 A presses, because 2017 did have 
one single improvement by Iwer Sonsch on

3:18:54.060,3:18:58.800
Stomp on the Thwomp. The Pedro spot 6 A 
press method had to use an extra jump at

3:18:58.800,3:19:02.460
the end because the angle Mario was coming 
at was not good enough to reach the star

3:19:02.460,3:19:07.439
directly. Iwer Sonsch simply found a better 
position and angle for the Pedro spot that

3:19:07.439,3:19:10.979
did allow for a direct jump to the star, 
and that was the improvement of the year.

3:19:11.939,3:19:19.200
But while 2017 was dry for the ABC, it also saw an 
unlikely resurgence: the return of real-time runs.

3:19:19.200,3:19:25.080
Ever since bobmario’s flamboyant entrance 
in 2007, the interest for real-time ABC had

3:19:25.080,3:19:30.600
fallen drastically, in favour of tool-assisted 
superplays. The ABC was seen more as a puzzle

3:19:30.600,3:19:35.939
than a test of skill. That changed when bad_boot 
took on the task of beating the game with 70

3:19:35.939,3:19:41.160
stars in a single segment in as few A presses as 
possible. This had never been attempted before;

3:19:41.160,3:19:45.479
the only thing that came close was Chris 
Oldfield’s 10 stars in no A presses,

3:19:45.479,3:19:51.660
16 years earlier, which was only marginally beaten 
by Japanese runner Altair with 12 stars in 2011.

3:19:51.660,3:19:56.460
So much had improved since then, but on the other 
hand, so many techniques were incredibly precise

3:19:56.460,3:20:01.080
and could never be replicated with human hands 
and a controller. Misalignments that require

3:20:01.080,3:20:06.779
lining up with a 1x1 unit square. Cloning, which 
requires tons of object slot manipulation and

3:20:06.779,3:20:11.880
precision. RNG and enemy manipulation, and any 
kind of hyperspeed technique, which were all

3:20:11.880,3:20:18.300
decidedly off limits. The task was monumental. 
But bad_boot was up to it. On September 24th,

3:20:18.300,3:20:24.779
2017, he sat down and gave it his best. He 
pressed on for over five hours. As always,

3:20:24.779,3:20:30.359
time was very much a secondary concern. When 
bad_boot defeated the final Bowser and collected

3:20:30.359,3:20:35.519
the giant star, his total A press count read 
46. He made a few mistakes along the way:

3:20:35.520,3:20:40.620
he used 38 planned A presses and 8 to 
retry sections where he fell. But overall,

3:20:40.620,3:20:44.580
this was a surprisingly good first attempt 
and a very high bar for others to clear.

3:20:44.580,3:20:50.580
A month later, bad_boot gave it another solid 
shot. This time, he had refined his strategy a

3:20:50.580,3:20:55.380
little bit: he got his planned A press count 
down to 34 before the run. And it went even

3:20:55.380,3:21:00.840
better than last time: he made zero mistakes 
in the entire run. He did choose to add one A

3:21:00.840,3:21:04.979
press for Scale the Mountain, instead of having 
to resort to the cloning strategy with a preset

3:21:04.979,3:21:10.080
HOLP in Tiny-Huge Island, for his own sake. 
So, after a bit less than five hours this time,

3:21:10.080,3:21:15.420
bad_boot had beaten Super Mario 64 
with 70 stars in only 35 A presses.

3:21:15.420,3:21:20.819
This record was incredibly good. Although it 
obviously didn’t include the most advanced

3:21:20.819,3:21:25.259
TAS-only solutions, it still made use of 
cloning, star dance clip, framewalking,

3:21:25.260,3:21:31.260
and plenty of crazy tricks. The run was so good 
that it stood as the 70-star record for years.

3:21:31.979,3:21:36.540
Meanwhile, other players were interested in 
the individual star approach. The starting

3:21:36.540,3:21:42.060
point was nearly ten years old and well over 
200 A presses. The strategies had evolved

3:21:42.060,3:21:47.040
beyond recognition in that time. With all this 
modern knowledge at hand, runners BillyWAR,

3:21:47.040,3:21:53.160
Lord SNEK, Th3_Re4l, Zyon, Ivan178 and a 
few others, including Pannenkoek himself,

3:21:53.160,3:21:59.639
started chipping away at the count. They 
crossed the 200 mark in November 2019. 2020

3:21:59.640,3:22:06.300
saw the most activity, with the total dropping 
from 180 in March to 116 in November. Finally,

3:22:06.300,3:22:11.399
the 100 barrier was broken on July 27th, 
2021, and the most recent improvement,

3:22:11.399,3:22:16.439
from as recently as December 12th, 
2022, brought the A press count to 78.

3:22:16.439,3:22:21.660
In the process, some truly incredible achievements 
were done, like The Pit and the Pendulums in only

3:22:21.660,3:22:27.359
3 A presses using super precise platforming to 
climb up the clock and to grab the star. Somehow,

3:22:27.359,3:22:31.259
this is not even the most impressive 
part of the run. To get off this pole,

3:22:31.260,3:22:35.220
BillyWAR sent a bob-omb to a preset 
HOLP high up in the air so it would

3:22:35.220,3:22:38.399
reactivate and fall on top of 
him, knocking him off the pole.

3:22:38.399,3:22:42.839
Another impressive feat was pulling off 
the hyperspeed walking and jump dive in

3:22:42.840,3:22:46.140
real time to get Watch for Rolling 
Rocks and A-Maze-ing Emergency Exit

3:22:46.140,3:22:49.439
in one A press each, done by BillyWAR and Ivan178.

3:22:49.439,3:22:54.120
And perhaps even crazier is Big 
Boo’s Merry-go-Round in 0 A presses,

3:22:54.120,3:23:00.059
something that even TASers only managed in 2015 
using 10 hours of scuttlebug raising. It was done

3:23:00.060,3:23:05.160
in real-time in August 2021 by BillyWAR using 
just a couple of minutes of scuttlebug raising,

3:23:05.160,3:23:09.540
and running into the scuttlebug with a 
crazy box. Taking damage while holding

3:23:09.540,3:23:13.859
a crazy box acts like instant release - it 
transports the box to the HOLP laterally,

3:23:13.859,3:23:18.299
but at Mario’s height. Using the hat in 
hand glitch prevents the crazy box from

3:23:18.300,3:23:22.680
rendering and updating the HOLP. By setting 
the HOLP at the right location beforehand,

3:23:22.680,3:23:26.701
BillyWAR sent the crazy box above the 
Merry-go-round, where it deactivated.

3:23:27.359,3:23:32.399
After spawning the star, he reactivated the crazy 
box and managed to grab it before it would fall

3:23:32.399,3:23:37.319
to the ground and break. He then bounced into 
the star, which completed the 0 A press run.

3:23:37.920,3:23:42.960
Sometimes, the real time ABC crew got very 
creative and found much simpler solutions

3:23:42.960,3:23:48.420
than what Pannenkoek had done years before. In 
the Deep Freeze was solved by bad_boot when,

3:23:48.420,3:23:53.700
to replace the TAS-only shell hyperspeed strategy, 
he simply lured a spindrift and bounced on it.

3:23:54.540,3:24:00.120
As far as full-game runs go, the real-time 
ABC needed a bit of extra motivation. So,

3:24:00.120,3:24:06.239
Pannenkoek announced a bounty in October 2020 
for people to beat bad_boot’s 35. Pannen was

3:24:06.239,3:24:11.519
giving out $50 per A press saved over the 
standing world record, until the end of 2020.

3:24:11.520,3:24:16.020
In the next couple of months, three players 
scrambled to get their A press count lower.

3:24:16.020,3:24:23.279
First came brqm. On November 7th, he fired up a 
run with a route that would ideally get him 26

3:24:23.279,3:24:28.019
A presses. After a few minor mistakes along 
the way, he ended up in Bowser in the Sky,

3:24:28.020,3:24:34.200
9 hours into the run, with 24 A presses. If 
he closed it out perfectly, he could edge out

3:24:34.200,3:24:39.540
the record by three. But he couldn’t handle 
the pressure. All it took was one bad fall.

3:24:40.380,3:24:47.160
Sadly, one fall turned into many, and frustration 
took over. He finished the run with 55.

3:24:47.939,3:24:53.160
The next day, BillyWAR, strong from his work on 
individual stars, also set out to beat the record.

3:24:53.160,3:25:00.720
His run went exceedingly well. He entered Bowser 
in the Sky after only 11 A presses. He didn’t

3:25:00.720,3:25:06.960
choke in the most stressful part of the run. 
He closed it out in just 21 total A presses.

3:25:06.960,3:25:13.979
Actually, not quite. After failing the star dance 
clip to enter Hazy Maze Cave, he had to reset to

3:25:13.979,3:25:21.419
retry it, causing his A press counter to lose 8 A 
presses. His real total was actually 29. Still, he

3:25:21.420,3:25:26.460
had beaten the record by 6 A presses and achieved 
pretty much exactly what he had set out to do.

3:25:26.460,3:25:31.319
At the end of November, a new runner by the 
name of PurpleJuiceBox entered the field.

3:25:31.319,3:25:37.739
After a 9-hour long effort, he managed to beat 
the record by another 3 A presses. Again, the A

3:25:37.739,3:25:43.139
press counter is wrong because of a reset, this 
time due to technical difficulties. In December,

3:25:43.140,3:25:48.420
PurpleJuiceBox continued to refine his strategies 
until the very end of the month. Meanwhile,

3:25:48.420,3:25:55.319
brqm was back with a vengeance. On December 27th, 
he did a run with an incredibly demanding 17 A

3:25:55.319,3:26:00.899
press route. He lost six along the way, but 
he was in Bowser in the Sky on a 23 A press

3:26:00.899,3:26:05.639
pace. But disaster struck again, and the 
record slipped from his hands once more.

3:26:06.300,3:26:10.620
brqm finished his run with 28 A 
presses, just shy of the record.

3:26:11.700,3:26:14.880
With less than 48 hours to go, on December 30th,

3:26:14.880,3:26:19.680
PurpleJuiceBox was ready to take on another 
run, this time with a 21 A press route.

3:26:19.680,3:26:25.080
He executed it near flawlessly. 
PurpleJuiceBox beat Super Mario

3:26:25.080,3:26:31.200
64 in 4 and a half hours using 22 
A presses. One single extra A press

3:26:31.200,3:26:35.939
was used at the start of Bowser in the Sky. 
And that is where the record stands today.

3:26:36.720,3:26:40.800
The 120-star category was deemed a 
bit too daunting by the real-time

3:26:40.800,3:26:46.920
ABC runners. It took until October 2021 for 
BillyWAR to take on the challenge. He put

3:26:46.920,3:26:53.520
together a route that would ideally get 163 
A presses. He ended up scoring 53 over that,

3:26:53.520,3:26:57.600
finishing out with 216. This record still stands.

3:26:57.600,3:27:03.479
Finally, another category held the attention 
of real-time runners: Max stars in 0 A presses.

3:27:03.479,3:27:10.859
Since Chris Oldfield’s 10 in 2001 and Altair’s 
12 in 2011, so much had changed. Technically,

3:27:10.859,3:27:14.580
up to 25 stars were now possible 
without Bowser in the Dark World,

3:27:14.580,3:27:20.399
which was still TAS only. Players battled in 
2020 to get as close as possible to the maximum,

3:27:20.399,3:27:25.019
a battle that was ultimately won 
by Zyon, on January 12th, 2021,

3:27:25.020,3:27:30.600
when he got all 25 possible stars and put 
this category to rest. Or so he thought.

3:27:31.200,3:27:39.359
On February 16th, 2022, Ivan178 completed Bowser 
in the Dark World with red coins in 0 A presses

3:27:39.359,3:27:46.080
in real-time. Yes, that star with the VSC. 
Yes, that star with the misalignment. Yes,

3:27:46.080,3:27:50.580
that star with the framewalking up the 
seesaw platform. A month and a half later,

3:27:50.580,3:27:56.519
he would get 34 stars in 0 A presses, thanks to 
the extra stars in the basement. To this day,

3:27:56.520,3:28:02.160
Ivan178 is still the only player to complete 
Bowser in the Dark World in 0 A presses in

3:28:02.160,3:28:06.899
real-time, and he has sole control over this 
record as a result. And this is where the

3:28:06.899,3:28:12.059
real-time A Button Challenge is today. After 
being dormant for 10 years, a small community

3:28:12.060,3:28:16.740
formed around it, and its members are still 
lowering the A press count on a regular basis.

3:28:17.399,3:28:23.519
March 2018. The first improvement of the year 
came in Jolly Roger Bay and was the result of

3:28:23.520,3:28:29.220
slow incremental progress over many years by 
Pannenkoek, Tyler Kehne and Maria Nicolae. First,

3:28:29.220,3:28:34.439
Mario framewalks up the pole to quickly gain a 
lot of sliding speed. Then, he gains a little

3:28:34.439,3:28:38.639
bit more on the bottom of the pole using a 
new technique called hyperspeed punching.

3:28:38.640,3:28:43.380
Normally, if Mario is moving fast enough, 
pressing B will make him dive, but Mario can

3:28:43.380,3:28:47.640
still punch at high speeds by using a slight 
control stick tilt on the frame he punches,

3:28:47.640,3:28:52.380
instead of a full tilt. During the punching 
action, Mario experiences a lower friction

3:28:52.380,3:28:57.720
than usual. If he’s standing on a steep enough 
slope, the downwards acceleration can overpower

3:28:57.720,3:29:03.120
this unusually low friction, causing him to gain 
speed. Thanks to sliding speed conservation,

3:29:03.120,3:29:08.760
he can reactivate that speed to quickly slide 
up the pole. Tyler Kehne had the idea of using

3:29:08.760,3:29:13.859
another punch to lose less speed while sliding 
up. The extra speed at the top of the pole,

3:29:13.859,3:29:18.899
combined with a precise dive, proved to be just 
enough to reach the platform and save the A press.

3:29:18.899,3:29:23.639
Then, two months went by without any 
improvements. Time and effort were

3:29:23.640,3:29:28.680
being poured into complex A press saves, but 
nothing came to fruition for a while. Until

3:29:28.680,3:29:33.840
the fateful night of May 26th, 2018, when an 
unsuspecting speedrunner by the name of Andru,

3:29:33.840,3:29:37.979
after practicing movement in Bowser 
in the Fire Sea, decided to go to bed

3:29:37.979,3:29:42.899
while leaving his console on overnight. The 
next morning, he found something strange.

3:29:42.899,3:29:48.000
The platforms had risen from the lava 
significantly. Over the next week,

3:29:48.000,3:29:52.859
a mad dash ensued as the community tried 
to understand and replicate this. Everyone

3:29:52.859,3:29:57.540
fired up their game and impatiently waited for 
something to happen in Bowser in the Fire Sea.

3:29:57.540,3:30:01.920
Andru was playing on Wii Virtual Console, 
which was immediately suspected as being

3:30:01.920,3:30:05.760
relevant. It quickly became apparent 
that the suspicions were correct:

3:30:05.760,3:30:10.260
whatever caused the platforms to rise from 
the lava seemed to be unique to the Wii VC

3:30:10.260,3:30:15.779
release. This made testing more inconvenient, 
because emulators could not replicate the issue.

3:30:15.779,3:30:21.899
Within just a few hours, bad_boot had pinpointed 
the cause of the glitch. The Nintendo 64

3:30:21.899,3:30:25.439
console and emulators, when performing 
a specific operation on float numbers,

3:30:25.439,3:30:29.700
round the result towards the nearest float 
number, whereas Wii VC truncates the float,

3:30:29.700,3:30:34.859
effectively rounding the result towards zero. 
Because the platforms are at a negative Y value,

3:30:34.859,3:30:40.200
as they bob up and down, their height ever 
so slightly drifts upwards. The problem is,

3:30:40.200,3:30:44.639
for them to rise up enough to become useful 
for the A button challenge, that rounding error

3:30:44.640,3:30:49.979
needs to happen roughly 8 million times. 
This takes about three days of real time.

3:30:49.979,3:30:56.519
Multiple excited community members such as 
Emilia, Barry, 1ted59 and SwitchPalaceCorner

3:30:56.520,3:31:01.680
began livestreaming on Twitch as they left their 
Wii on for days, watching the platforms rise

3:31:01.680,3:31:07.439
up like grass growing. Despite both technical 
and skill issues leading to multiple failures,

3:31:07.439,3:31:12.359
one thing became very clear: this 
new glitch worked. The rest of the

3:31:12.359,3:31:16.739
stage was a bit different now that the other 
sinking platforms, also drifting towards zero,

3:31:16.739,3:31:22.559
had sunk completely through the floor, leaving 
a very inhospitable fire sea. But Pannen had

3:31:22.560,3:31:27.960
no issue navigating that thanks to the safe 
zone on the edges. The very last A press in

3:31:27.960,3:31:34.020
70 star was finally solved. Super Mario 64 
was beatable without using the A button.

3:31:34.020,3:31:39.300
The solution to get off the pole in Bowser in 
the Fire Sea was to bypass the pole entirely.

3:31:39.300,3:31:45.060
After just a couple of days, danebou made a 
modified version of Mupen 64 that replicated the

3:31:45.060,3:31:50.819
rounding error found in Wii VC, so Pannenkoek was 
able to make a proper TAS. To get the red coins,

3:31:50.819,3:31:54.299
he simply entered the Bowser fight to 
reset the platforms back to normal,

3:31:54.300,3:31:58.020
then used the regular strategy found in 2014.

3:31:58.020,3:32:04.140
Of course, this A press save came with a massive 
caveat: again, it was exclusive to Wii. The

3:32:04.140,3:32:08.760
achievement of solving the A Button Challenge 
completely for 70 star felt a little hollow,

3:32:08.760,3:32:12.653
because it was abusing a glitch only 
present in an inaccurate emulated

3:32:12.653,3:32:19.260
rerelease. This also brought Wii VC back on 
par with Japanese Nintendo 64 for 120 star,

3:32:19.260,3:32:23.580
since there were now two different A press 
saves unique to each version that canceled out.

3:32:23.580,3:32:27.960
But the tie wouldn’t last very 
long. Just three weeks later,

3:32:27.960,3:32:32.040
with help from bad_boot to figure things 
out, and from Pannenkoek to string everything

3:32:32.040,3:32:37.319
together, Tyler Kehne unveiled the most 
off-the-wall insane ABC achievement yet:

3:32:37.319,3:32:42.239
entering the Secret Aquarium in 0 A 
presses without parallel universes.

3:32:48.120,3:32:52.080
Before we begin, I want to mention that 
this next section is heavily based on

3:32:52.080,3:32:55.260
the excellent video on bad_boot’s 
channel about this A press save.

3:32:55.920,3:33:01.200
The known strategy to enter the Secret Aquarium 
had one simple problem: to get from here to there,

3:33:01.200,3:33:05.519
Mario needs more speed than he can possibly 
have and still be able to get from here to

3:33:05.520,3:33:10.920
here. With PU speed not being an option, 
there had to be another solution. That

3:33:10.920,3:33:15.600
solution was the glitchy ledgegrab. No, 
not that glitchy ledgegrab. The other kind.

3:33:15.600,3:33:21.359
If you remember, to determine if Mario should grab 
a ledge, the game checks for a wall at two points:

3:33:21.359,3:33:27.599
30 units and 150 units above Mario’s position. 
On the staircase leading to Bowser in the Sky,

3:33:27.600,3:33:31.859
there are two ledges next to each other: the 
game checked for a wall at the lower ledge,

3:33:31.859,3:33:37.739
then checked for a floor at the higher ledge. This 
type of glitchy ledgegrab is a bit different. The

3:33:37.739,3:33:42.719
wall below the ledge to the Secret Aquarium 
is ever so slightly tilted. Between the points

3:33:42.720,3:33:48.540
at 30 and 150 units, the wall tilts away 
from Mario by one quarter of a unit. So,

3:33:48.540,3:33:52.380
there’s a gap of the same size where 
the wall check finds a wall at 30 units,

3:33:52.380,3:33:58.260
but not at 150 units, which triggers the floor 
check for a ledge grab. Like we’ve seen before,

3:33:58.260,3:34:02.819
this check can find a floor all the way 
up to 238 units above Mario’s position,

3:34:02.819,3:34:08.340
allowing Mario to grab the ledge from a lower 
height. But how much lower? Well, enough to

3:34:08.340,3:34:13.439
make coming in from this location viable. And 
that was all they needed to solve the puzzle.

3:34:13.439,3:34:18.120
Well, not quite. There was 
just one simple problem. Sure,

3:34:18.120,3:34:22.260
Mario could get from here to there with a 
lower speed than before, but there’s no way

3:34:22.260,3:34:27.239
to accurately guide Mario directly to the right 
spot below the ledge with such high speed. The

3:34:27.239,3:34:31.380
angle required is simply unattainable 
with that amount of speed. Thankfully,

3:34:31.380,3:34:36.540
sitting right there is the perfect way to 
redirect Mario to an arbitrary angle: a textbox.

3:34:36.540,3:34:40.620
Textboxes preserve Mario’s speed, 
but once the text is cleared,

3:34:40.620,3:34:45.540
he can turn to face any angle instantly, 
redirecting that speed to the new angle. This,

3:34:45.540,3:34:49.500
along with precise speed and positioning 
in front of the door, does allow Mario to

3:34:49.500,3:34:54.779
grab the ledge. But there was one simple 
problem. This textbox is only there if

3:34:54.779,3:35:00.300
Mario doesn’t have enough stars to open the 
door. Therefore, Mario must have zero stars.

3:35:00.300,3:35:05.220
It turns out this simple problem is a major 
issue, because it rules out hyperspeed walking

3:35:05.220,3:35:10.620
in Hazy Maze Cave. The method to enter Hazy 
Maze Cave requires getting a star from MIPS,

3:35:10.620,3:35:16.439
which also only shows up if Mario already has 
15 stars. If Mario can’t enter Hazy Maze Cave,

3:35:16.439,3:35:21.000
he can’t carry infinite speed into the 
castle lobby. What other level could be used?

3:35:21.000,3:35:27.960
Well, not many. With zero stars, only Bob-omb 
Battlefield is accessible. There’s also a way

3:35:27.960,3:35:33.000
to reach Vanish Cap under the Moat, but that one 
turns out not to be very helpful. Within Bob-omb

3:35:33.000,3:35:37.920
Battlefield, shell hyperspeed immediately comes 
to mind. But there’s just one simple problem:

3:35:37.920,3:35:42.060
the shell isn’t available until after 
getting stars 1 and 2 in the level,

3:35:42.060,3:35:46.140
so it can’t be used. Instead, 
C-up sliding saves the day.

3:35:46.140,3:35:51.300
As a refresher, when C-up is pressed on a 
downwards slope, Mario slides to a stop, but

3:35:51.300,3:35:56.520
the slope overpowers the friction from sliding, 
resulting in a net acceleration. This is enough

3:35:56.520,3:36:02.220
for Mario to gain over 200 speed. From there, 
Tyler Kehne was able to bounce Mario to a tree

3:36:02.220,3:36:08.819
and pause exit, which conserves Mario’s sliding 
speed. However, 230 speed is nowhere near the 900

3:36:08.819,3:36:14.219
or so required for Secret Aquarium. Instead, 
it’s used to send Mario to Bowser in the Dark

3:36:14.220,3:36:20.040
World without the required 8 stars. The first key 
can be obtained, and the basement is now unlocked.

3:36:20.040,3:36:25.800
In the basement, two more levels are accessible: 
Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land. Let’s

3:36:25.800,3:36:30.420
turn our attention towards the latter. In 
here, shell hyperspeed could generate a

3:36:30.420,3:36:35.700
few hundred speed, but again, it’s not enough. 
This time, hyperspeed punching saves the day.

3:36:35.700,3:36:41.160
In this corner of Shifting Sand Land, the visual 
geometry doesn’t match the actual level geometry:

3:36:41.160,3:36:45.420
everything in this zone is out of bounds. 
When Mario stands here and punches,

3:36:45.420,3:36:49.800
he accelerates forwards, but stays in place 
because he’s attempting to move out of bounds.

3:36:49.800,3:36:54.420
So long as he punches frame perfectly, he 
can build up infinite speed in this corner.

3:36:54.420,3:37:00.300
However, there’s one simple problem: as soon as 
Mario stops punching, he immediately and instantly

3:37:00.300,3:37:06.660
loses all but 32 speed. Thankfully, by pressing Z 
at the right time, Mario starts sliding instead,

3:37:06.660,3:37:12.540
which does conserve his speed. For one frame, 
at least. After one frame, Mario’s sliding

3:37:12.540,3:37:17.880
speed is capped to 100. But sliding also 
turns Mario slightly. With the right angle,

3:37:17.880,3:37:23.220
this can turn Mario towards a valid position 
in bounds. After one frame, Mario ends up in

3:37:23.220,3:37:28.319
the corner of the level, which happens to have a 
lower floor than the hyperspeed punching spot. So,

3:37:28.319,3:37:33.960
Mario enters freefall and gets to keep his high 
speed. And now, he gets to face several problems.

3:37:33.960,3:37:40.620
First of all, with 45 thousand speed, Mario is 
going way too fast. The target speed here is on

3:37:40.620,3:37:45.779
the order of 2 thousand. Secondly, he’s also 
headed face first towards out of bounds while

3:37:45.779,3:37:51.479
in the air, so he’s about to bonk. Last but not 
least, even if he could get out of this spot,

3:37:51.479,3:37:56.219
Mario needs a way to conserve his sliding 
speed into the castle lobby through a pause

3:37:56.220,3:38:02.460
exit. Solving all three problems was a stroke 
of pure genius from Tyler Kehne and bad_boot.

3:38:02.460,3:38:07.319
The first problem was solved with a koopa 
shell clone. A shell clone functions like

3:38:07.319,3:38:12.599
a normal shell, except that the clone stays in 
place and Mario rides an invisible shell. It

3:38:12.600,3:38:17.760
can also be reused; in fact, it’s used three 
different times in this level. The shell was

3:38:17.760,3:38:22.260
used here for an important property: if Z 
is pressed while Mario is riding a shell,

3:38:22.260,3:38:28.020
he starts crouch sliding. Again, there’s one 
small problem. This doesn’t work if Mario is

3:38:28.020,3:38:32.399
airborne. But thankfully, on the first frame 
where Mario is on the shell, the game doesn’t

3:38:32.399,3:38:36.719
check for that condition and Mario can press 
Z to crouch slide despite being in the air.

3:38:36.720,3:38:41.700
So, with one extra frame of sliding, another 
trick could be used to bring the speed down to

3:38:41.700,3:38:46.979
a workable value: the 10k glitch. When the 
control stick is pulled back while Mario is

3:38:46.979,3:38:51.359
sliding, a multiplier is applied to his 
speed to slow him down. The multiplier

3:38:51.359,3:38:55.559
is meant to slow Mario down slightly more 
drastically the faster he’s moving, so it

3:38:55.560,3:39:00.420
follows this formula. More specifically, 
for every 10 thousand speed Mario has,

3:39:00.420,3:39:05.700
the multiplier goes down by one. So, if Mario 
has a speed in the tens of thousands or higher,

3:39:05.700,3:39:11.040
this formula can yield very interesting results. 
Here, by tilting the joystick ever so slightly

3:39:11.040,3:39:16.920
backwards, it’s used to instantly bring Mario’s 
speed from 45 thousand down to only 2 thousand.

3:39:16.920,3:39:22.500
But there is, you guessed it, one simple 
problem. For Mario to land on the Koopa shell,

3:39:22.500,3:39:27.420
he needs to fall down on it. Although he’s in 
freefall, he hasn’t started falling down yet.

3:39:27.420,3:39:32.160
But if he spends one more frame in the air, 
he will bonk instead. Mario needs something

3:39:32.160,3:39:37.200
to fall without bonking. Enter the fire 
clone. When Mario is burning in the air

3:39:37.200,3:39:41.760
and moving towards out of bounds, he keeps his 
speed, but falls straight down. From there,

3:39:41.760,3:39:46.260
he can land on the shell clone, crouch to start 
sliding, pull the control stick back to activate

3:39:46.260,3:39:51.660
the 10k glitch and bring his speed down to 2 
thousand, but then what? He still has no way

3:39:51.660,3:39:56.460
of conserving that speed through a pause exit, 
and by the way, he’s still headed face first

3:39:56.460,3:40:01.500
into out of bounds. This is where the final 
piece of this puzzle comes in: a fly guy.

3:40:01.500,3:40:07.380
With this lower speed, Mario can move for 
one quarterstep before bonking. On the frame

3:40:07.380,3:40:11.700
that he bonks, his speed doesn’t get killed 
immediately; only on the next frame does it

3:40:11.700,3:40:18.359
get set to -16. However, the bonk is canceled by 
landing on the fly guy before the speed is capped,

3:40:18.359,3:40:23.880
so Mario’s speed ends up being conserved and he 
starts twirling. After that, he can wait until the

3:40:23.880,3:40:28.920
perfect moment to land and pause exit on the first 
frame to conserve his speed into the castle lobby.

3:40:28.920,3:40:34.500
But there’s one simple problem. How do you 
get all this stuff in the corner like that?

3:40:34.500,3:40:39.960
The short answer is cloning and Fly guy 
manipulation. Now for the long answer.

3:40:40.739,3:40:45.779
The Fly guy is nothing we haven’t seen before. 
The annoying ones are the fire clone and the

3:40:45.779,3:40:51.179
koopa shell. The shell can be found in this block, 
which would be easy to reach with a tornado. But

3:40:51.180,3:40:56.880
it only shows up after getting star 3, so on 
zero stars, there is no tornado here. Instead,

3:40:56.880,3:41:01.080
the only method to get the shell is to 
open the box remotely and clone the shell.

3:41:01.080,3:41:05.519
This can be done with a preset HOLP from 
another level, namely Bob-omb Battlefield.

3:41:05.520,3:41:09.479
It just so happens that the perfect 
location for this is on the floating island,

3:41:09.479,3:41:13.979
so to get the HOLP there, Mario needs to clone 
a goomba and use the bloated bob-omb glitch.

3:41:13.979,3:41:19.500
No big deal so far. After placing the HOLP, 
Mario can then fall onto the slippery slope,

3:41:19.500,3:41:23.580
get 200 speed, and clip into Bowser 
in the Dark World with a preset HOLP.

3:41:24.239,3:41:29.580
Now, an issue: when Mario fights Bowser for the 
key, he needs to grab Bowser, which automatically

3:41:29.580,3:41:34.559
updates the HOLP. There’s no such thing as hat in 
hand here, and instant release, while seemingly

3:41:34.560,3:41:39.479
promising at first glance, doesn’t actually work 
in this case. But remember: the HOLP updates when

3:41:39.479,3:41:44.219
the game needs to draw the object Mario is 
holding. If we can’t make Bowser invisible,

3:41:44.220,3:41:50.100
what if we made Mario invisible? It turns out 
that we can, using pause-buffered hitstun.

3:41:50.100,3:41:55.920
After taking damage, Mario is invincible for 30 
frames, or until he’s no longer colliding with

3:41:55.920,3:42:02.160
a source of damage. This blinking during those 
invincibility frames is determined by the global

3:42:02.160,3:42:07.739
timer, a timer that simply goes up by one on 
every frame from power on. If this timer is even,

3:42:07.739,3:42:13.019
Mario will be visible, and if it’s odd, Mario will 
be invisible. The global timer doesn’t stop when

3:42:13.020,3:42:17.700
the game is paused, so it is possible to only 
unpause the game while the global timer is odd,

3:42:17.700,3:42:22.380
causing Mario to remain invisible during the 
invincibility frames. In that short time,

3:42:22.380,3:42:27.239
he can grab and release objects without updating 
the HOLP. This is pause-buffered hitstun.

3:42:27.239,3:42:32.460
After all this work, Mario enters Shifting 
Sand Land with the HOLP intact. Again,

3:42:32.460,3:42:37.800
the hat in hand glitch is unavailable because the 
wing cap requires 10 stars and Klepto is too busy

3:42:37.800,3:42:43.140
carrying a star around to steal Mario’s hat. 
So, pause-buffered hitstun has to be used to

3:42:43.140,3:42:48.720
perform the remote releases. First, a bob-omb is 
thrown to the HOLP, where it deactivates. Then,

3:42:48.720,3:42:52.859
another bob-omb is used for cloning. 
When Mario gets near the high bob-omb,

3:42:52.859,3:42:57.479
it falls down and breaks the box, spawning 
the koopa shell which Mario clones. He walks

3:42:57.479,3:43:01.019
all the way to this spot to release 
it, and uses it to get around faster.

3:43:01.020,3:43:06.600
Then, this Fly guy is manipulated while the 
other Fly guy is lured into spitting fire for

3:43:06.600,3:43:11.340
Mario to clone. Pause-buffered hitstun 
had to be used extensively here. Mario

3:43:11.340,3:43:15.720
stays inside of the Pokey to extend his 
invincibility period until he can walk up

3:43:15.720,3:43:20.640
the slope. When the Fly Guy spits fire, Mario 
clones it and drops it at the HOLP laterally,

3:43:20.640,3:43:25.680
but at Mario’s height, which places the fire 
clone just above the koopa shell clone. Then,

3:43:25.680,3:43:29.483
Pannenkoek finishes the Fly guy manipulation and 
every piece is now in place. He heads over to the

3:43:29.483,3:43:29.580
hyperspeed punching spot and builds up speed for 
40 minutes. Then, he pulls off this masterpiece.

3:43:29.580,3:43:35.760
Mario crouches which turns him. He gets burned so 
not to bonk, lands on the shell to start sliding

3:43:35.760,3:43:40.200
again, and the stick is pulled slightly backwards 
to trigger the 10k glitch and instantly bring

3:43:40.200,3:43:46.019
Mario speed to 2 thousand. He bonks but cancels 
that bonk before his speed is capped, sending

3:43:46.020,3:43:51.600
him into a twirl at 2300 speed. He lands with the 
right speed and angle and into the lobby he goes.

3:43:51.600,3:43:57.300
Now that Mario is in the lobby with 2000 speed, 
here comes the easy part. Just kidding! It’s

3:43:57.300,3:44:02.220
actually the hard part. First, one thing to 
keep in mind is that high speed movement is

3:44:02.220,3:44:07.620
very limited. Mario can only turn by up 
to 1/32nd of a turn, or about 11 degrees,

3:44:07.620,3:44:13.260
in a single frame. This severely hinders movement 
options. Unlike when traveling at PU speed,

3:44:13.260,3:44:17.399
where most of the possible positions would be 
out of bounds anyway, Mario doesn’t have the

3:44:17.399,3:44:22.439
liberty of choosing which angle he wants to move 
in next. He sort of always has to hug the walls.

3:44:22.439,3:44:27.960
The other major limitation is floor hitboxes, 
which only extend 78 units below the floors.

3:44:27.960,3:44:34.260
This means that in any single quarterstep, Mario 
can only ever move up to 78 units upwards. That’s

3:44:34.260,3:44:39.359
why he can’t just go up the central staircase 
normally. For the final glitchy ledgegrab to work,

3:44:39.359,3:44:44.219
Mario needs about 920 speed, but to get 
up the central staircase, he can have at

3:44:44.220,3:44:49.680
most about 500 speed. Instead, he will need to 
come at it sideways, from as high as possible.

3:44:49.680,3:44:55.439
The lobby movement, again solved by Tyler Kehne, 
can be subdivided into five main sections:

3:44:55.439,3:45:00.540
entering the Jolly Roger Bay room, landing on 
this pillar, reaching the 8-star door, reaching

3:45:00.540,3:45:06.060
the 1-star door, and finally, grabbing the Secret 
Aquarium ledge. Let’s go through them one by one.

3:45:06.060,3:45:10.979
The first part is reaching the Jolly Roger 
Bay room, which is quite a bit higher. First,

3:45:10.979,3:45:15.599
Mario’s stored speed sends him into the Whomp’s 
Fortress room, where he has to carefully turn

3:45:15.600,3:45:19.380
around and navigate back to the main 
lobby. After reaching this staircase,

3:45:19.380,3:45:24.000
Mario needs to zigzag up to gain height 
in small enough increments. The geometry

3:45:24.000,3:45:28.439
of this area just barely allows it to 
work. If the stairs had one more step

3:45:28.439,3:45:32.819
or if Mario needed slightly more speed, going 
up this staircase would have been impossible.

3:45:32.819,3:45:38.279
Once in the Jolly Roger Bay room, Mario is now at 
the highest point he can be before heading towards

3:45:38.279,3:45:43.139
the central staircase. However, he can’t go 
directly to the staircase because at this angle,

3:45:43.140,3:45:47.640
he would shoot past it and into the Bob-omb 
Battlefield room. Instead, he has to aim at

3:45:47.640,3:45:53.220
the pillar next to the staircase. The pillar is 77 
units higher than the floor Mario is currently on,

3:45:53.220,3:45:57.479
so he has a grand total of one and a 
half frames to reach it. This is why,

3:45:57.479,3:46:02.759
despite only needing 900 speed at the end, 
Mario needs to have 1700 speed at this point.

3:46:02.760,3:46:07.739
In order to reach the pillar, Tyler aimed 
Mario towards the railing. On this frame,

3:46:07.739,3:46:12.239
Mario’s next intended position after one 
quarterstep is right here, less than one

3:46:12.239,3:46:17.760
unit inside of it. The railing is 51 units wide, 
so there is a one unit gap where only the outside

3:46:17.760,3:46:23.399
wall affects Mario, allowing him to get pushed by 
it. He gets pushed into the pillar’s wall hitbox,

3:46:23.399,3:46:28.319
but the wall check is over, so he doesn’t get 
affected by it right away. Then, because Mario

3:46:28.319,3:46:33.239
is inside the floor hitbox, he gets pushed up 
to it and lands. This sequence works because

3:46:33.239,3:46:38.460
the game treats collision checks in the order of 
walls first, floors second, and ceilings last.

3:46:38.460,3:46:43.260
Tyler dives here and does a dive recover 
on the pillar for a very specific reason:

3:46:43.260,3:46:48.359
when Mario lands from that dive recover, he can 
instantly turn. By turning in this direction,

3:46:48.359,3:46:53.339
he now tries to move into a ceiling, which leaves 
him stuck in place, allowing him to let his speed

3:46:53.340,3:46:59.160
come down to 1100 for the next section. But during 
the dive recover, he needs something to keep him

3:46:59.160,3:47:04.859
in place. That thing is the other railing. Mario’s 
first quarterstep leads him in the railing,

3:47:04.859,3:47:09.599
which has two overlapping opposite wall 
hitboxes that cancel each other out. So,

3:47:09.600,3:47:14.100
after this double wall push, Mario’s position 
is inside of a ceiling, which not only prevents

3:47:14.100,3:47:18.720
him from moving there, but also negates 
his vertical speed. If he did get vertical

3:47:18.720,3:47:22.680
speed from the dive recover, Mario would’ve 
caught the top of the railing and fallen off.

3:47:22.680,3:47:28.680
Once Mario’s speed drops down to 1100, he’s 
ready to head to the 8-star door. He spends

3:47:28.680,3:47:32.580
one frame on the staircase, which lowers 
his de facto speed just enough to avoid

3:47:32.580,3:47:36.840
falling off. Then, he manages to turn 
towards the star door and trigger the

3:47:36.840,3:47:40.800
text as far left as possible. This 
is important for the next section.

3:47:40.800,3:47:46.560
After closing the text, Mario can now redirect his 
speed in any direction. Because he’s on the left

3:47:46.560,3:47:51.840
side of the door, he has a near direct line to 
the 1-star door, which he reaches in three frames.

3:47:51.840,3:47:56.399
He needs to trigger that text with a very precise 
speed and position, so he waits some speed

3:47:56.399,3:48:00.960
out and then clips inside of the Princess’s 
Secret Slide room to realign himself. Then,

3:48:00.960,3:48:05.880
Tyler makes use of a neat high speed trick to 
redirect Mario towards the door. If Mario is

3:48:05.880,3:48:11.040
pushing up against a wall and C-up is pressed, 
Mario will instantly face directly at the wall.

3:48:11.040,3:48:15.840
With high negative speed, this causes him 
to shoot away from the wall perpendicularly,

3:48:15.840,3:48:20.220
no matter his prior facing angle. This 
leads him into the door’s textbox.

3:48:20.220,3:48:25.680
Again, after closing it out, Mario can redirect 
his speed, this time towards the Secret Aquarium

3:48:25.680,3:48:31.140
entrance. All that’s left is to perfectly aim at 
the quarter unit gap and do a glitchy ledge grab.

3:48:32.100,3:48:36.540
And there it was. Entering the 
Secret Aquarium in zero A presses,

3:48:36.540,3:48:39.120
compatible with the Nintendo 64 console.

3:48:48.060,3:48:53.700
After this enormous achievement, the A button 
challenge community could sit back and relax. For

3:48:53.700,3:49:00.120
a while, nothing really happened. Alright, that’s 
enough. What if we saved two A presses this time?

3:49:04.439,3:49:10.080
This new development was a joint effort by 
bad_boot, Sidney and Tyler Kehne. It makes use

3:49:10.080,3:49:15.779
of a trick discovered in February by bad_boot 
and Sidney: Hyperspeed grinding. It requires

3:49:15.779,3:49:20.700
a specific spot where a bit of steep floor is 
next to a gap in the floor and a wall. Mario

3:49:20.700,3:49:25.620
runs off the steep floor, making him airborne. 
On the next frame, the wall pushes him back,

3:49:25.620,3:49:30.660
and the stick is held back towards the floor, 
so he lands. This cycle is repeated for as long

3:49:30.660,3:49:35.639
as needed. Because of the landing frame, Mario’s 
speed is normally kept in check by friction and

3:49:35.640,3:49:40.560
he can’t accelerate beyond the normal speed 
cap of 32. But if the floor is steep enough,

3:49:40.560,3:49:44.700
Mario has no friction when landing, so he 
can build up speed to a certain degree.

3:49:44.700,3:49:50.460
Because of limitations with geometry, this method 
can be used to build up to roughly 400 speed at

3:49:50.460,3:49:55.859
best. Despite that, it could still prove useful, 
so long as there existed a spot that filled all

3:49:55.859,3:50:00.839
the requirements in Tick Tock Clock. This is 
where Sidney came in and found the edge of this

3:50:00.840,3:50:05.760
treadmill. Here, it works slightly differently: 
Mario is getting a push from two wall hitboxes

3:50:05.760,3:50:10.739
at once, which combine to send him back on the 
treadmill where he lands. After gathering enough

3:50:10.739,3:50:15.840
speed, Mario can do a hyperspeed jump dive and 
reach the next level in a single A press instead

3:50:15.840,3:50:21.120
of two. Finally, Tyler Kehne executed the strategy 
to save the A press, and Pannenkoek, as always,

3:50:21.120,3:50:26.279
strung everything together. He published The Pit 
and the Pendulums in one A press, and Timed Jumps

3:50:26.279,3:50:32.040
on Moving Bars from 3 down to 2 A presses. Stomp 
on the Thwomp, the only other star higher than

3:50:32.040,3:50:37.019
this, still used the Pedro spot strategy, so no 
other A press could be saved with this new trick.

3:50:37.680,3:50:40.859
As soon as hyperspeed grinding 
was proven possible, though,

3:50:40.859,3:50:44.819
an alternate strategy for Timed 
Jumps on Moving Bars was revisited.

3:50:44.819,3:50:49.080
Over the years, many alternate methods were 
found that completed stars in the same amount

3:50:49.080,3:50:53.040
of A presses, but with wildly different 
routes, sometimes faster, sometimes not.

3:50:53.040,3:50:58.140
One of these was for Timed Jumps on Moving 
Bars. Instead of using a bob-omb to reach

3:50:58.140,3:51:02.040
the Roll into the Cage star and then two 
A presses to get up to the timed bars,

3:51:02.040,3:51:07.380
one could instead use three A presses to reach the 
timed bars, and repurpose the bob-omb to clip into

3:51:07.380,3:51:12.720
the final cage instead of jumping to it. A way to 
get up the cogs without the bob-omb was theorized,

3:51:12.720,3:51:17.520
but never actually accomplished, because both 
amounted to 4 A presses in total, or 3 with

3:51:17.520,3:51:22.500
pendulum manipulation. But with the discovery 
of hyperspeed grinding, suddenly, where the

3:51:22.500,3:51:27.960
original route saved one A press, the alternate 
route saved two. So, the alternate method became

3:51:27.960,3:51:33.120
the main one. But first, they had to actually 
get up these cogs, not just think about it.

3:51:33.120,3:51:37.439
The problem actually doesn’t lie within the 
cogs themselves, but with this platform,

3:51:37.439,3:51:41.339
which is slightly too high to just dive 
recover to, given that it’s not oriented

3:51:41.340,3:51:45.479
properly for a misalignment to exist. 
But, with enough conserved vertical speed,

3:51:45.479,3:51:50.519
it would be possible to grab the ledge. They 
just needed to land on the cog with positive

3:51:50.520,3:51:55.500
vertical speed, and get pushed off at the right 
time to reactivate that speed. Piece of cake.

3:51:55.500,3:52:01.680
On the random setting, cogs spin back and forth 
like this. As they rotate, their wall hitboxes

3:52:01.680,3:52:06.300
move around as well, creating openings on the 
corners from time to time. More specifically,

3:52:06.300,3:52:10.500
there is a misalignment on the corner found in 
this region of the cog, because this section

3:52:10.500,3:52:15.720
points away from the origin. This is both a 
blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because

3:52:15.720,3:52:20.340
a misalignment makes it possible for Mario to 
land on the cog with positive vertical speed.

3:52:20.340,3:52:26.220
It’s a curse because this spot seemed just out 
of reach. It wasn’t just that Mario needed to

3:52:26.220,3:52:30.239
land there, he needed to get there with enough 
vertical speed to grab the ledge afterwards.

3:52:30.239,3:52:35.219
Using mathematical models and calculations, 
DeRockProject and Sidney ended up finding

3:52:35.220,3:52:40.739
that yes, this strategy was indeed just barely 
possible. The cog’s wall on the previous frame

3:52:40.739,3:52:45.779
could be used to help Mario get increased distance 
to reach the misalignment. Using their guidance,

3:52:45.779,3:52:51.120
Pannenkoek was able to TAS it, and the route was 
complete. The rest stayed relatively unchanged

3:52:51.120,3:52:55.680
until the end: hyperspeed grinding to get up 
here in one A press, then pendulum manipulation

3:52:55.680,3:53:00.239
to save another. But then, the bob-omb they 
repurposed falls down from way above, and

3:53:00.239,3:53:05.519
Mario grabs it bloated to clip into the cage. The 
HOLP was placed in Bowser in the Sky beforehand,

3:53:05.520,3:53:11.340
and the bob-omb was released at the HOLP using 
pause-buffered hitstun. Just two weeks after

3:53:11.340,3:53:16.140
being brought to 2 A presses, Timed Jumps 
on Moving Bars was already down to just one.

3:53:17.520,3:53:23.220
Two months later, on September 26th, 2018, Stomp 
on the Thwomp underwent a revolution when a new

3:53:23.220,3:53:28.439
Pedro spot was found here. Well, actually, the 
Pedro spot itself was already known to exist,

3:53:28.439,3:53:34.200
but no one knew how to get Mario lodged in 
there like that. Until ds273 found a way

3:53:34.200,3:53:39.599
to knock Mario into the Pedro spot without an A 
press, using pendulum manipulation and a bob-omb.

3:53:39.600,3:53:44.399
The old 5 A press route, the one with 4 A 
presses at the start and one hyperspeed jump

3:53:44.399,3:53:48.299
dive, went flying out of the window. 
Instead, it was replaced with this.

3:53:49.020,3:53:52.920
The beginning is basically the same as 
The Pit and the Pendulums in 1 A press;

3:53:52.920,3:53:58.620
only the HOLP is in a slightly different position. 
Then, two different RNG manipulations are done at

3:53:58.620,3:54:03.059
the same time: pendulum manipulation, and the 
rotating clock hand at the top of the stage.

3:54:03.060,3:54:07.920
Pendulum manipulation is used to make 
the pendulum end a spin here. This is

3:54:07.920,3:54:12.239
actually nearly a full rotation, so when it 
swings back, it swings upwards to return to

3:54:12.239,3:54:16.559
angle zero. This lodges Mario in the 
ceiling and reactivates the bob-omb,

3:54:16.560,3:54:20.760
which falls on top of him and knocks him 
onto the pendulum’s box. This allows Mario

3:54:20.760,3:54:25.439
to turn towards a suitable angle for what 
comes next. When the pendulum swings back

3:54:25.439,3:54:29.639
around, the shaft pushes Mario off the 
pendulum box and into the Pedro spot.

3:54:29.640,3:54:34.800
Once Mario is in the Pedro spot, he builds up 
to over 600 speed and jumps out of the spot,

3:54:34.800,3:54:38.580
instantly landing on the floor above. 
To preserve his vertical speed,

3:54:38.580,3:54:43.680
he instantly pushes C-up to enter first 
person. Otherwise, the landing would instantly

3:54:43.680,3:54:48.359
bring his speed to zero. Then, he punches 
repeatedly until he leaves this platform,

3:54:48.359,3:54:53.819
where the conserved speed sends him flying 
upwards. He lands directly on the clock hand.

3:54:53.819,3:54:59.880
This is why RNG was being manipulated before. 
After getting on the hand in 2 A presses,

3:54:59.880,3:55:04.080
all that was needed was to wait for it to make 
three quarters of a turn, and jump on the thwomp

3:55:04.080,3:55:09.720
to get the star in three. This saved two A presses 
at once for the second time in a couple of months.

3:55:10.439,3:55:15.660
After completing this run, Pannenkoek and 
crew were not satisfied. The Pedro spot could,

3:55:15.660,3:55:20.040
on paper, give enough vertical speed to Mario to 
reach all the way up to the star. The problem,

3:55:20.040,3:55:24.359
though, was how disjointed the Pedro spot 
was from the Thwomp. While Mario could

3:55:24.359,3:55:28.199
jump all the way up to the star, he couldn’t 
cross the horizontal distance in that time,

3:55:28.199,3:55:32.460
since having to resort to VSC to get past 
this platform killed all of his forward

3:55:32.460,3:55:36.060
momentum. The solution they found was double VSC.

3:55:36.060,3:55:41.760
The route is mostly the same up to this point. 
This time, Mario builds up almost 700 speed,

3:55:41.760,3:55:46.199
which gives him a little bit more vertical 
momentum. Once he shoots off this platform,

3:55:46.199,3:55:51.420
he lands on the clock hand by having it turn 
under him. Pressing C-up on the frame Mario lands

3:55:51.420,3:55:56.520
preserves his vertical speed, on top of stopping 
him on a dime. Then, the hand rotates towards the

3:55:56.520,3:56:01.560
thwomp, and Mario releases the remaining vertical 
speed to land on it and save yet another A press.

3:56:01.560,3:56:07.260
The highest star in the toughest stage for the A 
button challenge was down to only two A presses.

3:56:07.260,3:56:10.199
But hold on. Clock hands are 
supposed to move clockwise.

3:56:11.040,3:56:16.199
That’s quite literally the definition of 
clockwise. How does the hand turn backwards

3:56:16.199,3:56:21.479
like that? The answer is RNG manipulation, 
and a lot of it. The problem, though,

3:56:21.479,3:56:25.739
is that once Mario enters the Pedro spot, 
there is no longer a way to manipulate RNG.

3:56:25.739,3:56:31.979
So, before getting into the Pedro spot, Pannenkoek 
spent an extra 9 minutes manipulating the hand so

3:56:31.979,3:56:36.479
it would turn counterclockwise by a third of 
a turn. Despite being on the random setting,

3:56:36.479,3:56:41.879
the clock hands still favor moving clockwise. If 
you let the clock run without interference long

3:56:41.880,3:56:46.620
enough though, the clock hand will eventually 
turn by this much counterclockwise. The only

3:56:46.620,3:56:51.120
problem is it typically takes on the 
order of weeks. That’s… not ideal.

3:56:51.120,3:56:55.680
So, Pannenkoek wrote a program that 
simulated the clock on a random setting,

3:56:55.680,3:56:59.939
and used it to calculate a way to 
affect the RNG so that 12 minutes later,

3:56:59.939,3:57:04.979
the clock hand would move exactly the way he 
wanted. His script found dozens of solutions,

3:57:04.979,3:57:07.799
and Pannen simply picked one 
of the more convenient ones.

3:57:07.800,3:57:16.500
2018 turned into 2019. The community was as active 
and dedicated as ever to find A press saves,

3:57:16.500,3:57:21.479
but they were getting exponentially harder to 
come by. Even Tick Tock Clock, which was still

3:57:21.479,3:57:27.000
responsible for 17 A presses not that long ago, 
had seriously dried up and was down to only 8.

3:57:27.000,3:57:32.699
It was time to think outside the box. What if, 
instead of trying to remove A presses from the

3:57:32.699,3:57:39.479
total, they started adding them back? This 
is Get a Hand, up from 0 to 0.5 A presses.

3:57:39.479,3:57:43.199
If you’ve been following, you might 
know where this is going. First,

3:57:43.199,3:57:47.880
adding a half A press in Tick Tock Clock doesn’t 
hurt. It’s assumed that the star would come

3:57:47.880,3:57:52.500
after entering the level for the first time, an 
action that still incurred an A press. Second,

3:57:52.500,3:57:56.880
the half A press is useful here because it 
allows Mario to kick, which in turn lets

3:57:56.880,3:58:01.560
him fall down with backwards momentum. This 
sets things up for spawning displacement.

3:58:01.560,3:58:06.779
There is one major issue though. The previous 
spawning displacement was achieved on The Pit

3:58:06.779,3:58:11.880
and the Pendulums, which is directly above, 
and very much above, Get a Hand. Despite that,

3:58:11.880,3:58:16.859
Mario has barely enough speed to land on the 
lowest of the spinners. If Mario were to kick

3:58:16.859,3:58:22.739
the wall and get this star, he’d be way short 
of the spinners. This one was solved by ds273.

3:58:22.739,3:58:28.139
The problem with kick recoil momentum is that 
the speed Mario inherits is a fixed negative

3:58:28.140,3:58:33.420
48. But the ABC crew figured out that while 
it’s true that Mario’s speed can’t be changed,

3:58:33.420,3:58:38.160
speed isn’t the only way to move Mario: 
he can also get pushed by walls. If Mario

3:58:38.160,3:58:43.019
finds himself inside a wall hitbox, because 
the hitbox is 50 units wide on each side,

3:58:43.020,3:58:47.880
he can theoretically get pushed by double that, 
or 100 units perpendicularly to that wall.

3:58:47.880,3:58:52.439
Now, because the ABC experts were trying to push 
Mario in the same direction as his movement,

3:58:52.439,3:58:55.319
that proved to be a bit tricky, 
because Mario would need to enter

3:58:55.319,3:58:59.279
the wall from behind for this to work. 
But thanks to pendulum manipulation,

3:58:59.279,3:59:04.620
it was possible to have the wall itself move 
into Mario instead. Unfortunately, even that

3:59:04.620,3:59:10.260
wall push ended up being too weak to move Mario 
enough to reach the spinners - by a factor of 10.

3:59:10.260,3:59:15.180
That idea was not gonna work. It was tough 
enough to get Mario to get pushed by a wall

3:59:15.180,3:59:21.300
in the right direction once, let alone 
ten times. Until ds273 had a new idea.

3:59:21.300,3:59:25.859
The pendulum is made up of many tiny 
triangles to give the illusion of a

3:59:25.859,3:59:31.019
round shape. As it turns out, in this specific 
spot, many different triangles converge into

3:59:31.020,3:59:36.180
a single point. Theoretically, if Mario ended 
up exactly on that point, he could technically

3:59:36.180,3:59:41.160
be inside of all of these triangles’ wall 
hitboxes at once. Like we’ve seen before,

3:59:41.160,3:59:45.840
when Mario is in multiple wall hitboxes 
at the same time, he receives a combined

3:59:45.840,3:59:50.760
push from all of them. So, if Mario ended up 
inside of all of these walls, he could get a

3:59:50.760,3:59:56.280
wall push from each of these triangles. And 
how many triangles is that? Ten triangles.

3:59:56.880,4:00:02.460
The path forward was clear. The goal was to 
get Mario in this point in the star fall action

4:00:02.460,4:00:07.260
with kick recoil momentum. Then, he would 
get a massive push from ten walls at once,

4:00:07.260,4:00:11.399
and move just barely far enough to 
star dance clip onto the spinner. Now,

4:00:11.399,4:00:13.679
the question was: how do you get Mario in there?

4:00:13.680,4:00:19.560
Well, the answer was not easy. Unlike floors, 
wall collisions do use floating point numbers,

4:00:19.560,4:00:24.120
so the point where these ten triangles 
converge is one single floating point number,

4:00:24.120,4:00:32.220
or 0.000025 units wide. Also, for all ten 
triangles to be walls at the same time,

4:00:32.220,4:00:36.840
the pendulum needs to be at a very specific 
angle, so extensive manipulation was also

4:00:36.840,4:00:41.939
required. The point itself was also a little 
bit too high; Mario somehow needed to kick the

4:00:41.939,4:00:48.299
wall from slightly higher than this platform. 
That wasn’t enough to discourage ds273. Here’s

4:00:48.300,4:00:52.140
the route that he came up with, and that 
Pannenkoek successfully TASed afterwards.

4:00:52.140,4:00:57.840
First, there needs to be a carefully preset 
HOLP. Tall Tall Mountain can be used do to

4:00:57.840,4:01:02.340
just that. Next, Pannen uses instant release 
to send two bob-ombs at the HOLP laterally,

4:01:02.340,4:01:07.140
but at slightly different heights. This is 
so they can be reactivated later in very

4:01:07.140,4:01:11.939
specific positions. Then, after climbing up 
to the turning hand, Pannen manipulates the

4:01:11.939,4:01:17.819
pendulum for 18 minutes until it starts making 
full rotations. He reactivates the first bob-omb,

4:01:17.819,4:01:21.299
which he wants to grab. Since he 
has to hold A to kick later on,

4:01:21.300,4:01:25.560
he can’t just grab it normally, so he has 
to use the ledge to dive grab it instead.

4:01:25.560,4:01:29.819
He grabs it slightly bloated, which 
gives Mario a weak backwards push.

4:01:29.819,4:01:34.920
Then, he reactivates the second bob-omb so 
that it snaps to Mario’s position and explodes,

4:01:34.920,4:01:40.199
pushing him through the wall. He normally wouldn’t 
be able to stand in there, but here, he can for

4:01:40.199,4:01:45.179
two reasons. First, objects like bob-ombs can push 
Mario into positions that he normally wouldn’t be

4:01:45.180,4:01:50.100
able to reach by himself, like inside ceilings 
or out of bounds. We’ve seen this twice before

4:01:50.100,4:01:54.779
in Stomp on the Thwomp. Second, this area is 
not out of bounds, because there is a floor

4:01:54.779,4:01:59.699
directly below. It’s inside of a ceiling, which 
traps Mario in mid-air, but doesn’t immediately

4:01:59.699,4:02:04.679
kill him like out of bounds would. The swinging 
pendulum passes by, and Mario can walk on it,

4:02:04.680,4:02:09.120
which ever so slightly moves him upwards to the 
correct vertical position for the float precise

4:02:09.120,4:02:13.800
wall push. Then, he keeps moving inside of the 
ceiling thanks to the bob-omb pushing him around,

4:02:13.800,4:02:18.420
until he gets to a fraction of a unit behind 
the wall, the perfect spot for the final part.

4:02:18.420,4:02:24.120
The inputs and RNG to get to this point required 
brute forcing to reach the exact values needed.

4:02:24.120,4:02:30.359
Now, all Pannen can do is wait. When the pendulum 
is about to turn into the exact angle that yields

4:02:30.359,4:02:35.639
the float precise ten triangle overlap, Mario 
kicks and starts moving backwards. He enters

4:02:35.640,4:02:40.680
the wall hitbox and gets clipped back in bounds. 
His kick collides with the wall on the same frame

4:02:40.680,4:02:45.779
that he touches the star. Then, he inherits 
-48 speed and the pendulum turns into him.

4:02:45.779,4:02:51.540
He enters the float precise point where ten 
wall hitboxes coincide. In a single frame,

4:02:51.540,4:02:56.340
he gets pushed one thousand units backwards, 
which happens to be just barely enough to star

4:02:56.340,4:03:01.020
dance clip at the very bottom of the 
spinner. Finally, one small bit of RNG

4:03:01.020,4:03:05.819
manipulation before this whole ordeal ensured 
at at this precise moment, the spinner would

4:03:05.819,4:03:10.080
start spinning clockwise and provide spawning 
displacement to save the re-entry A press.

4:03:11.279,4:03:18.779
All 120 stars were now obtainable in nineteen 
A presses. The ABC crew had done it: the whole

4:03:18.779,4:03:23.880
game was under 20. The A Button Challenge had 
completed its twenty-two-year transition from

4:03:23.880,4:03:28.739
a fun little distraction in the corner of an IRC 
chat, to the most convoluted and well-researched

4:03:28.739,4:03:34.019
video game puzzle of all time. As complex and 
difficult the new A press saves had become,

4:03:34.020,4:03:39.300
it was worth the effort. With a community as 
large as ever filled with talented experts working

4:03:39.300,4:03:44.760
together tirelessly, the sky was the limit. 
But despite so many technical advancements,

4:03:44.760,4:03:51.300
no discovery that came after this ever directly 
helped. The A press count remained frozen at 19.

4:03:51.840,4:03:56.880
Months became years. Ultimately, still 
sitting at 7 A presses by itself,

4:03:56.880,4:04:02.699
Tick Tock Clock had won. In 2022, 
the A press count is still 19.

4:04:28.800,4:04:34.620
The date is July 6th, 2022. The ABC 
community finally unveils not one,

4:04:34.620,4:04:39.479
not two, but three A press saves at the 
same time, all of them in Tick Tock Clock.

4:04:39.479,4:04:45.419
Of the hundreds of A presses once needed 
to collect all the stars, only 16 remain.

4:04:57.060,4:05:00.899
Though it seemed that the ABC had been 
dormant for a while, the new developments

4:05:00.899,4:05:05.879
in Tick Tock Clock actually had been in the 
making for years. In fact, ever since 2016,

4:05:05.880,4:05:11.340
there was one leading idea to lower Stomp on the 
Thwomp to only one A press. At its inception,

4:05:11.340,4:05:16.500
it could save up to 8 A presses on three 
different stars. It was a very simple idea,

4:05:16.500,4:05:21.840
with just one small problem. How 
small? About the scale of the universe.

4:05:22.439,4:05:27.599
The idea involved the old Pedro spot 
strategy. That method was stunted by

4:05:27.600,4:05:32.100
having to enter the level while the clock is 
still, which made reaching the Pedro spot so

4:05:32.100,4:05:36.540
much more inconvenient than what a moving 
clock could provide. So, what if, instead,

4:05:36.540,4:05:41.460
the Pedro spot could be used while the clock 
was on the random setting? Theoretically,

4:05:41.460,4:05:46.080
through the magic of RNG manipulation, the cog 
could stay in place for long enough that Mario

4:05:46.080,4:05:49.859
could build up all the speed he needed to 
jump straight up to the Thwomp at the top

4:05:49.859,4:05:53.699
of the clock. But here’s the small 
problem: to stay still for so long,

4:05:53.699,4:05:58.739
assuming purely random conditions, the cog 
needed to roll a one in seven chance, 1200

4:05:58.739,4:06:04.679
times. Simply finding a solution that worked would 
take longer than the heat death of the universe.

4:06:04.680,4:06:09.300
There were a few redeeming elements that 
made the actual odds slightly better.

4:06:09.300,4:06:14.279
Iwer Sonsch made a detailed analysis of the 
probabilities with a more optimistic outlook

4:06:14.279,4:06:19.080
and found that the odds were much better than 
Pannenkoek’s initial calculation. Specifically,

4:06:19.080,4:06:24.239
he found that once Mario has enough speed, 
the cog can turn by some tiny amount without

4:06:24.239,4:06:29.519
breaking the Pedro spot. But regardless of how 
you spin it, the improbability of the strategy

4:06:29.520,4:06:34.319
outscaled the number of possibilities that could 
be tested by dozens of orders of magnitude.

4:06:34.319,4:06:38.759
So, while the Random Cog Pedro Spot 
idea was alluring in its simplicity,

4:06:38.760,4:06:44.699
it was impossibly intimidating in its execution. 
It remained in limbo for over six years,

4:06:44.699,4:06:51.120
waiting for something to be found that would make 
it computable. But that never happened. Instead,

4:06:51.120,4:06:54.779
it was its competing idea, a much 
more complex one on the surface,

4:06:54.779,4:06:58.979
that prevailed in July 2022 and 
saved three A presses at once.

4:06:59.580,4:07:04.140
To get some context on the discoveries that 
led to the improvements, we need to step all

4:07:04.140,4:07:09.359
the way back to March of 2018. Tyler Kehne 
and bad_boot were brainstorming strategies

4:07:09.359,4:07:13.859
to get past the pole in Bowser in the Fire 
Sea on console. During their research, they

4:07:13.859,4:07:19.019
found a promising and peculiar trick that stems 
from a very obscure interaction: squish cancel.

4:07:19.739,4:07:25.139
When a ceiling and a floor are close together, 
Mario can’t quite fit in that spot. This is the

4:07:25.140,4:07:30.120
mechanic that makes Pedro spots what they are. 
However, if at least one of them is dynamic,

4:07:30.120,4:07:33.660
in other words if it belongs to an 
object, Mario will get squished instead.

4:07:33.660,4:07:38.279
Now, if at least one of the surfaces involved 
in the squish happens to be very slanted,

4:07:38.279,4:07:42.719
by more than 60º, as Mario is getting 
squished, he also gets pushed off by

4:07:42.720,4:07:46.979
10 units. If that push happens to be 
enough to take him off the floor he’s on,

4:07:46.979,4:07:51.239
then he suddenly finds himself squished 
by nothing, in mid-air. To prevent that,

4:07:51.239,4:07:56.580
on the next quarterstep, his action state is 
set to idle instead. Finally, on the next frame,

4:07:56.580,4:08:01.319
Mario can either do an action like a jump 
from that state, or he simply enters freefall.

4:08:01.319,4:08:06.239
The reason this was so promising is that 
squish cancel happens to preserve Mario’s

4:08:06.239,4:08:10.380
horizontal speed while it resets his 
action back to idle. But there’s also

4:08:10.380,4:08:15.899
an unexpectedly useful side-effect: it also 
zeroes out Mario’s vertical speed. Ultimately,

4:08:15.899,4:08:19.679
the goal was to use this in combination 
with high speed collisions with bullies,

4:08:19.680,4:08:22.199
but there were missing pieces to the puzzle and,

4:08:22.199,4:08:27.239
despite all their best efforts for years and 
years, this idea could never be fully realized.

4:08:27.239,4:08:32.460
A few months later, though, in August 2018, 
a TASer by the name of Super Watermelon 64

4:08:32.460,4:08:36.180
was playing around in Jolly Roger Bay 
when he encountered a very odd glitch:

4:08:36.180,4:08:39.000
Mario could dive twice for seemingly no reason.

4:08:39.000,4:08:42.840
This turned out to be the accidental 
discovery of remote squish cancel.

4:08:43.620,4:08:48.840
If you remember, ceilings extend up infinitely 
until there’s a floor above them. Sometimes,

4:08:48.840,4:08:52.739
due to imperfect geometry or rounding 
errors, a ceiling that’s supposed to have

4:08:52.739,4:08:57.420
a floor above it has a tiny sliver that 
doesn’t. This exposed ceiling stretches

4:08:57.420,4:09:00.720
infinitely upward and causes what’s 
commonly called an invisible wall.

4:09:00.720,4:09:06.120
If the ceiling happens to have a floor immediately 
under it and one of them is part of an object,

4:09:06.120,4:09:10.739
then all the requirements are met to squish Mario, 
even though he’s far higher than the game would

4:09:10.739,4:09:15.660
expect him to be. When Mario is squished, he 
instantly downwarps to the floor below him.

4:09:15.660,4:09:21.420
But if there’s a steep slope and Mario gets pushed 
out, his action is set to idle instead. From that

4:09:21.420,4:09:26.640
point, he can jump or enter freefall again while 
preserving his speed. Because all of this happens

4:09:26.640,4:09:30.960
way above the place that would actually squish 
Mario, this is known as remote squish cancel.

4:09:30.960,4:09:34.560
Immediately, bad_boot found 
that under perfect conditions,

4:09:34.560,4:09:38.220
the pendulums in Tick Tock Clock could 
fulfill the requirements to enable Mario

4:09:38.220,4:09:42.359
to perform a remote squish cancel. At 
the time, nothing concrete was found

4:09:42.359,4:09:46.019
to have it directly save an A press, 
but it was one more tool in the box.

4:09:46.020,4:09:50.460
The other trick that was found during that time, 
though, was much more evidently groundbreaking.

4:09:50.460,4:09:57.120
On May 1st, 2021, ds273 published the 
discovery of Behind Camera Anywhere.

4:09:57.840,4:10:03.600
Behind Camera Anywhere, or BCA for short, is a 
surprisingly simple trick. At any given time,

4:10:03.600,4:10:07.500
the camera has a focus point. Now you would 
think that focus point should be Mario,

4:10:07.500,4:10:11.160
but as it turns out, that would look 
a bit odd and annoying. Instead,

4:10:11.160,4:10:14.699
the camera is looking at a constantly 
evolving point that’s roughly this

4:10:14.699,4:10:18.359
much ahead of where Mario is looking. 
Now, if you lock the camera in place,

4:10:18.359,4:10:23.639
the focus point will still behave as normal. If 
Mario goes really close to the camera, the focus

4:10:23.640,4:10:28.260
point in front of him can end up on the other 
side. The camera always looks at the focus point;

4:10:28.260,4:10:32.520
therefore, Mario can end up behind the camera, 
so long as he’s looking in the right direction.

4:10:32.520,4:10:36.600
To save on resources, anything that 
isn’t in the current field of view

4:10:36.600,4:10:41.040
of the camera isn’t being rendered, because 
it wouldn’t be on screen anyway. That’s true

4:10:41.040,4:10:44.519
even of Mario himself. If he’s 
far enough behind the camera,

4:10:44.520,4:10:49.920
then he no longer gets rendered. And you know 
what that means? If Mario isn’t being rendered,

4:10:49.920,4:10:54.239
then whatever he’s holding also isn’t being 
rendered, so the HOLP does not get updated!

4:10:54.239,4:10:58.859
That’s right: Behind Camera Anywhere is 
yet another HOLP preservation method,

4:10:58.859,4:11:03.719
adding to the Hat in Hand glitch, instant 
release, and pause-buffered hitstun. Of course,

4:11:03.720,4:11:08.520
it comes with its own set of challenges. Mario 
needs to grab and release an object all while

4:11:08.520,4:11:13.439
keeping himself behind and his focus point in 
front of the static camera. That’s a pretty

4:11:13.439,4:11:17.040
restrictive situation that effectively 
prevents moving around with the object,

4:11:17.040,4:11:22.080
and also limits Mario’s facing angle during the 
trick. Nonetheless, Behind Camera Anywhere would

4:11:22.080,4:11:26.640
prove extremely useful to streamline a lot of 
existing cloning strategies, and it even found

4:11:26.640,4:11:32.760
its way into real-time ABC. But most importantly, 
BCA enabled new possibilities for crazy routes

4:11:32.760,4:11:37.920
in Tick Tock Clock. Combined with remote squish 
cancel and a few thousand hours of working out,

4:11:37.920,4:11:42.420
this discovery led to the three A press saves 
in Tick Tock Clock, fourteen months later.

4:11:43.260,4:11:48.779
The idea boils down to solving one problem: 
getting past this section of the level in no A

4:11:48.779,4:11:53.519
presses. The stars The Pit and the Pendulums, 
Timed Jumps on Moving Bars and Stomp on the

4:11:53.520,4:11:58.500
Thwomp all rely on clearing this section. The 
existing method bypassed the whole thing in one

4:11:58.500,4:12:03.359
A press with hyperspeed grinding. To go from 
one to none, though, a completely different

4:12:03.359,4:12:08.880
strategy was needed. It can be broken down 
into three steps. First, crossing this gap,

4:12:08.880,4:12:13.140
which has been solved for years using a 
bloated bob-omb. Second, getting up to here,

4:12:13.140,4:12:17.760
which can be done with a dive recover into a 
fire clone and a star dance clip. And finally,

4:12:17.760,4:12:22.859
dismounting the pole, which can be solved with 
another conveniently placed fire clone. And that’s

4:12:22.859,4:12:29.040
it! With just these three steps, the whole section 
is cleared in no A presses. Actually, not quite.

4:12:29.040,4:12:33.899
It’s easy to look at each individual problem 
within a level and find a solution that misses

4:12:33.899,4:12:38.819
the bigger picture. This is one of those. The 
star dance clip looks like a great solution,

4:12:38.819,4:12:44.519
but it actually isn’t. It’s all because this 
gap already uses a star dance clip. You can

4:12:44.520,4:12:49.439
only spawn one 100-coin star at once, but 
here, you would somehow need two. One of

4:12:49.439,4:12:56.219
them has to go. This is where ds273 came up with 
an absolutely crazy plan that could, in theory,

4:12:56.220,4:13:01.620
get rid of this star dance clip. But it was a bit 
of a lunatic idea that had no business actually

4:13:01.620,4:13:08.760
being possible. Until a newcomer, SJMHRP, jumped 
into the problem head first. She created various

4:13:08.760,4:13:14.340
programs to search for the one perfect alignment 
of stars that allowed ds’s insane plan to work.

4:13:14.340,4:13:20.880
This task was astronomical. But after a thousand 
hours of work over eight months, and after over

4:13:20.880,4:13:26.760
ten thousand computational hours to search through 
billions of permutations of conditions, she found

4:13:26.760,4:13:28.260
a solution. And this is where the strategy goes 
from pretty complex to mindbendingly complex. Sit

4:13:28.260,4:13:30.899
down, buckle up, and put your helmet on.

4:13:30.899,4:13:35.339
Let’s get it out of the way right off the 
bat. Mario rides a pendulum into the ceiling,

4:13:35.340,4:13:39.540
he gets squished and burned, then repeatedly 
ground pounds to gain height, all the way up until

4:13:39.540,4:13:44.580
he grabs the ledge at the top. Finally, he pulls 
a bob-omb out of his pocket and uses it to cross

4:13:44.580,4:13:49.739
the gap. That’s it, that’s how it’s done, and now 
we need to spend twenty minutes understanding why.

4:13:55.260,4:14:00.720
The first step of this ordeal is to manipulate the 
pendulum. It needs to reach a very specific state,

4:14:00.720,4:14:06.420
so a total of 61 minutes of manipulation is 
required to do so. After this much manipulation,

4:14:06.420,4:14:11.340
it’s now spinning so fast that it does 
50 full rotations per swing. But it’s

4:14:11.340,4:14:15.060
not just the speed that’s important: 
it’s also the exact angles that the

4:14:15.060,4:14:18.540
pendulum will be taking at various 
times a couple dozen frames apart.

4:14:18.540,4:14:24.000
Next, Mario rides the pendulum up into the 
ceiling. Normally, he should get squished,

4:14:24.000,4:14:28.920
but there’s a 10-unit gap where Mario is stuck 
in the ceiling without being squished. So long

4:14:28.920,4:14:35.040
as Mario keeps walking, he stays stuck in that 
ceiling. If he stops walking, he falls down. So,

4:14:35.040,4:14:38.160
after a few minutes of waiting for the 
pendulum to reach the correct state,

4:14:38.160,4:14:43.260
Mario falls back down and gets carried up into 
the ceiling. This happens because collisions

4:14:43.260,4:14:48.359
are processed in the order of walls, floors 
and ceilings. Mario snaps up to the pendulum

4:14:48.359,4:14:53.460
before the ceiling has anything to say about it. 
Also, Mario doesn’t take damage because he goes

4:14:53.460,4:14:58.020
from being lightly squished straight to being 
fully inside of the ceiling in a single frame.

4:14:58.020,4:15:02.520
Now, Mario shouldn’t be able to move around 
in here, but the pendulum provides a floor for

4:15:02.520,4:15:06.600
him to stand on. But to be able to reach 
the higher section, Mario needs a fire

4:15:06.600,4:15:11.699
bounce from a fire clone. For now, we’ll skip 
explaining why Mario clips inside the pendulum,

4:15:11.699,4:15:16.319
and how the clone got there. We’ll get 
back to that later. After more precise

4:15:16.319,4:15:20.219
mid-air walking and waiting, the conditions 
are finally perfect for the magic trick.

4:15:20.880,4:15:26.160
Mario turns until he faces out. He ever so 
slightly enters the back of the wall hitbox,

4:15:26.160,4:15:31.800
clipping him back out. Then, he ground pounds. As 
the pendulum rotates, it enters a position where,

4:15:31.800,4:15:35.160
because of imperfect geometry, an 
exposed ceiling squishes Mario,

4:15:35.160,4:15:40.139
canceling the ground pound and resetting his 
vertical speed back to zero. On the same frame,

4:15:40.140,4:15:45.600
he’s pushed out of the exposed ceiling. On the 
next frame, he enters freefall. From there, he can

4:15:45.600,4:15:49.920
move into the next spot that will have an exposed 
ceiling, and ground pound again to gain height.

4:15:49.920,4:15:55.680
In total, this trick is repeated seven times. 
This is why the pendulum manipulation was so

4:15:55.680,4:16:01.920
crucial. The pendulum needs to create seven squish 
cancel spots at regular intervals of about 7 to 10

4:16:01.920,4:16:07.319
frames, with no exposed ceilings in between. Mario 
can only move by a tiny amount between each ground

4:16:07.319,4:16:12.359
pound, so all seven squish cancel spots need 
to be very close to each other. At the start,

4:16:12.359,4:16:16.679
the pendulum needs to stay below Mario, 
otherwise he’d bonk into it. And finally,

4:16:16.680,4:16:20.699
because the pendulum is only tangible if Mario 
is close enough to it, as Mario goes higher,

4:16:20.699,4:16:25.679
the angle range the pendulum can take gets smaller 
and smaller. When Mario is at the very top,

4:16:25.680,4:16:30.300
he’s too far from the pendulum to do any more 
squish cancels, but he’s still too low to grab

4:16:30.300,4:16:36.239
the ledge. Thankfully, ds273 had one last 
trick up his sleeve: a glitchy ledge grab.

4:16:36.239,4:16:41.819
This wall is made up of two sections that 
seamlessly combine to create one surface. But as

4:16:41.819,4:16:46.559
it turns out, due to some floating point rounding 
nonsense, each section has an ever so slightly

4:16:46.560,4:16:51.960
different normal vector. As a result, there is a 
float precise position where Mario’s 30-unit check

4:16:51.960,4:16:57.359
finds the lower wall, but the 150-unit check does 
not find the higher wall, and he grabs the ledge

4:16:57.359,4:17:03.660
from way below. This glitchy ledge grab was found 
on November 14th, 2020, and it was the last piece

4:17:03.660,4:17:09.720
of the puzzle ds273 needed to devise his master 
plan. Once on this spot, Mario could use a bob-omb

4:17:09.720,4:17:13.979
to cross the gap, a star dance clip to get up 
the elevator, and a fire clone to dismount the

4:17:13.979,4:17:19.019
pole. But hold on: how do you get all this stuff 
here in the first place? We need to rewind a bit.

4:17:19.560,4:17:24.120
The last one is the simplest: this fire clone 
is placed at the beginning of the stage using

4:17:24.120,4:17:29.160
a preset HOLP from Tall, Tall Mountain and Behind 
Camera Anywhere. But despite being the simplest,

4:17:29.160,4:17:32.699
it’s not that simple, because Mario 
needs one of these bob-ombs for cloning,

4:17:32.699,4:17:36.899
yet the object he’s cloning is all the 
way up here. He needs to find a way to

4:17:36.899,4:17:41.040
carry an object for an extended time without 
updating the HOLP at any step of the process.

4:17:41.040,4:17:46.500
First, Mario makes both bob-ombs explode one frame 
apart. He grabs one of them. Just as he grabs it,

4:17:46.500,4:17:51.840
the other bob-omb is unloaded. This causes the 
bob-omb’s spawner to load into Mario’s hands.

4:17:51.840,4:17:57.180
Like we’ve seen before, a spawner is an invisible 
object. Because it’s invisible, it doesn’t need

4:17:57.180,4:18:02.220
to be rendered, which in turn doesn’t update the 
HOLP. Mario then carries that invisible object

4:18:02.220,4:18:07.439
up until it also unloads and can be replaced. 
At the exact moment when it’s replaced with the

4:18:07.439,4:18:12.120
newly loaded fire object, Mario is now behind 
the camera, so again, the HOLP is not updated.

4:18:12.120,4:18:17.640
Mario throws the fire clone to the HOLP, where it 
sits waiting to burn Mario off the pole later on.

4:18:17.640,4:18:22.859
The clones on the elevator are more interesting, 
but we’ll get to those later. I did promise that

4:18:22.859,4:18:26.339
I would explain how these fire clones 
got here. There are three of them:

4:18:26.340,4:18:30.840
one has to be used as a sacrifice to prevent 
Mario from activating the useful fire clones

4:18:30.840,4:18:34.439
too early. The clones were placed 
by setting the HOLP under this spot,

4:18:34.439,4:18:40.199
then using BCA to drop them at the HOLP laterally, 
but at Mario’s height. The range of usable heights

4:18:40.199,4:18:44.399
for the fire clones was pretty restricted, which 
made the whole strategy harder to pull off.

4:18:44.399,4:18:49.500
And now, we take a look at how the bob-omb 
magically appears in this spot. It uses

4:18:49.500,4:18:53.880
a known trick, the out of bounds failsafe 
mechanism, but in a new way. In the past,

4:18:53.880,4:18:58.319
the bob-omb was placed using a preset HOLP from 
another level that happened to be out of bounds

4:18:58.319,4:19:03.059
in Tick Tock Clock. But here, the preset HOLP 
is already in use, and there can only be one.

4:19:03.060,4:19:07.859
There needs to be a way to place a bob-omb out 
of bounds from within the level. Of course,

4:19:07.859,4:19:13.019
Mario normally can’t go out of bounds. On the rare 
occasion that he does find himself out of bounds,

4:19:13.020,4:19:17.399
he dies immediately. Needless to say, 
this proved to be quite a challenge for

4:19:17.399,4:19:22.319
ds273 to solve. The solution he came 
up with is nothing short of amazing.

4:19:25.380,4:19:31.140
Here’s how the HOLP can be set out of bounds. Just 
below this treadmill, 31 units below to be exact,

4:19:31.140,4:19:36.359
there is a wall overlap. When Mario dives with a 
bob-omb onto the edge, the moving treadmill moves

4:19:36.359,4:19:41.580
Mario off, which does two things. First, Mario 
enters a hands free holding state, and second,

4:19:41.580,4:19:48.059
his vertical speed of -24 is conserved. After 
one frame of falling, Mario’s speed is now

4:19:48.060,4:19:53.340
-28. On the second frame’s first quarterstep, 
Mario moves down by a quarter of that speed,

4:19:53.340,4:19:58.500
or 7 units. He precisely enters the wall 
overlap and gets moved outside of the level.

4:19:58.500,4:20:04.560
But wait! That’s out of bounds! How can Mario 
be out of bounds without instantly dying? Well,

4:20:04.560,4:20:09.840
he actually isn’t. Even outside of the walls of 
the level, Mario isn’t immediately out of bounds.

4:20:09.840,4:20:14.699
As it turns out, the floor at the very bottom of 
the clock extends a little bit outside the walls.

4:20:14.699,4:20:19.739
Mario is only treated as out of bounds if there 
is no floor under him, so technically, he is still

4:20:19.739,4:20:25.319
in bounds. After falling for a bit, Mario dives, 
which he can do while hands free holding. He hits

4:20:25.319,4:20:30.059
the actual out of bounds and bonks, which releases 
the bob-omb and knocks him back into the level.

4:20:30.060,4:20:35.819
Meanwhile, the HOLP, which is in front of Mario’s 
position when he’s diving, ends up out of bounds.

4:20:35.819,4:20:39.479
Now, a bob-omb needs to be released 
there with some remote release method:

4:20:39.479,4:20:44.639
either pause-buffered hitstun, behind camera 
anywhere, or instant release. This turns out

4:20:44.640,4:20:49.739
to be more challenging than it seems because 
of the 4000-unit activation radius. For the

4:20:49.739,4:20:53.399
failsafe to trigger, Mario needs to 
enter the bob-omb’s activation radius,

4:20:53.399,4:20:58.080
which is this sphere. But the HOLP is too 
low for that radius to intersect this ledge,

4:20:58.080,4:21:03.239
so the bob-omb needs to be released at the HOLP 
laterally, at about this height instead. However,

4:21:03.239,4:21:08.040
at the moment when the bob-omb is released, Mario 
needs to be outside of this zone. Otherwise,

4:21:08.040,4:21:11.939
the failsafe would be triggered immediately 
and the bob-omb would snap to Mario’s position.

4:21:11.939,4:21:17.939
This creates a bit of a problem, considering the 
bob-ombs are right here. But what if they weren’t?

4:21:17.939,4:21:22.919
Prior to setting this HOLP, Mario clones one 
of the bob-ombs by reloading it from above

4:21:22.920,4:21:28.140
the spinners. He uses that bomb to clip through 
the wall on the moving bar. Again, despite being

4:21:28.140,4:21:33.479
outside the walls, the moving bar provides a floor 
for Mario to stand on. He releases the bomb here,

4:21:33.479,4:21:38.519
setting the HOLP in this weird semi-out of 
bounds spot. Then, he clones another bob-omb,

4:21:38.520,4:21:44.520
making sure to avoid updating the HOLP. Using 
BCA, he throws it out of bounds. Something weird

4:21:44.520,4:21:49.439
happens: the bob-omb goes to the HOLP, but 
gets stuck in a weird mid-air oscillation.

4:21:49.439,4:21:54.960
This sparks a few questions. Why does it 
do that? Because it’s out of bounds. When

4:21:54.960,4:21:58.859
a bob-omb tries to move out of bounds, its 
movement is reversed, which normally should

4:21:58.859,4:22:03.000
send it back towards the map. But when 
that new position is also out of bounds,

4:22:03.000,4:22:08.040
it runs into the same issue on the next frame. 
The net result is the bob-omb oscillates between

4:22:08.040,4:22:12.779
two out of bounds positions, reversing its 
movement on every frame. But why is it out

4:22:12.779,4:22:17.639
of bounds if it it’s just above the moving bar? 
Because just like any other object with collision,

4:22:17.640,4:22:22.140
moving bars are only tangible if Mario 
is close to them. Because he’s not,

4:22:22.140,4:22:26.699
there’s no floor here and the bob-omb is indeed 
out of bounds. But if it’s out of bounds,

4:22:26.699,4:22:31.739
why doesn’t it snap to Mario? Because the 
failsafe only triggers when Mario drops a

4:22:31.739,4:22:36.359
bob-omb. When he throws a bob-omb, it goes to 
the HOLP, regardless of if it’s in bounds or not.

4:22:36.359,4:22:41.099
So, Mario throws the bob-omb out of bounds, 
where it remains until he goes right next to

4:22:41.100,4:22:45.899
the moving bar to make it tangible. During that 
time, he sets up the out of bounds HOLP using

4:22:45.899,4:22:50.819
the treadmill for the next part. When he comes 
back to the moving bar, the bob-omb falls on it

4:22:50.819,4:22:55.620
and clips back in bounds. Just as it’s about 
to explode, Mario dives and performs instant

4:22:55.620,4:23:00.239
release on the bloated bob-omb. This sends it 
to the HOLP laterally, but at Mario’s height,

4:23:00.239,4:23:04.679
far enough away that it deactivates 
until Mario enters its radius. But also,

4:23:04.680,4:23:09.899
the radius happens to intersect this ledge. We’ve 
finally got the bob-omb where it needs to be.

4:23:09.899,4:23:15.660
This, however, creates a new problem. Remember, 
Mario cannot enter the bob-omb’s activation

4:23:15.660,4:23:21.180
radius until the exact moment when he’s ready to 
use it. The radius intersects the destination,

4:23:21.180,4:23:25.439
sure, but it also passes right through the 
section where Mario rides the pendulum into

4:23:25.439,4:23:29.639
the ceiling. To avoid reactivating the 
bob-omb early, Mario actually needs to

4:23:29.640,4:23:34.380
clip inside the pendulum as he’s going up. 
Thankfully, there happens to be a tiny,

4:23:34.380,4:23:39.779
one unit wide sliver of floor inside the 
pendulum for Mario to stand on. He gets

4:23:39.779,4:23:45.059
squished by the pendulum and finds himself on 
that one unit slice of ground. He gets burned

4:23:45.060,4:23:49.199
while narrowly avoiding the walls and the 
bob-omb’s activation radius, and he reaches

4:23:49.199,4:23:54.960
the top of the pendulum with one sector of health 
remaining. At last, after the whole squish cancel

4:23:54.960,4:23:59.580
ground pound chain sequence, Mario can enter 
the radius and snap the bob-omb next to him.

4:24:00.120,4:24:05.460
One more detail. Because the bob-omb is bloated 
at its maximum size, when it snaps to Mario’s

4:24:05.460,4:24:09.899
position, it pushes Mario out through 
the wall and inside the cage. But also,

4:24:09.899,4:24:13.739
because the bob-omb is so big, it 
touches the cage’s wall hitboxes;

4:24:13.739,4:24:18.840
both the outside wall and the inside wall. The 
outside wall doesn’t push it any further out,

4:24:18.840,4:24:23.400
but the inside wall pushes it all the way 
inside the cage, so it clips in alongside Mario.

4:24:24.060,4:24:27.899
Finally, Mario can grab it and use it 
to cross the gap towards the elevator.

4:24:27.899,4:24:32.939
And that’s when we finally get to these two 
clones. How did they get here? Remember,

4:24:32.939,4:24:38.279
they can’t use their own preset HOLP because there 
can only be one. The solution is very simple:

4:24:38.279,4:24:44.759
you take all of the steps needed to reach this 
spot, the entire thing, and you do it twice. The

4:24:44.760,4:24:48.840
first time, after crossing the gap with the 
bob-omb, you use that bob-omb to place the

4:24:48.840,4:24:54.540
HOLP here. Then, you go back down and use BCA 
to release a coin and a fire clone. Finally,

4:24:54.540,4:24:58.140
you do all of this again and get back 
up, this time with all the right tools

4:24:58.140,4:25:03.780
to climb the rest of the way. After all of this 
work, Mario gets past the pole in 0 A presses.

4:25:04.620,4:25:10.739
If only it were that simple. Remember, the pole 
isn’t the end here! Several challenges remain.

4:25:10.739,4:25:15.420
First of all, because there are three instances 
of spawning displacement to re-enter the clock,

4:25:15.420,4:25:20.699
the level can only be entered with a preset 
HOLP a total of three times. Get a Hand needs

4:25:20.699,4:25:25.559
a preset HOLP, which leaves only two uses of 
a preset HOLP for three stars that need it.

4:25:25.560,4:25:30.479
The second problem is that the Pedro spot 
VSC strategy for the end of Stomp on the

4:25:30.479,4:25:35.339
Thwomp required a different preset HOLP to 
send a bob-omb high above Mario. The third

4:25:35.340,4:25:40.260
problem is that Timed Jumps on Moving Bars also 
required its own preset HOLP for the bob-omb

4:25:40.260,4:25:45.180
clip at the end. How could all of these extra 
bob-ombs and preset HOLPs ever be reconciled?

4:25:45.180,4:25:51.659
Well, the third one was actually solved in 
September of 2018 by ds273. It turns out the

4:25:51.659,4:25:56.159
overuse of preset HOLPs with limited opportunities 
to enter Tick Tock Clock from anywhere in the

4:25:56.159,4:26:01.559
castle was spotted as a potential issue back then 
as well. In an effort to cut preset HOLPs out,

4:26:01.560,4:26:05.760
ds273 figured out Timed Jumps on Moving 
Bars without the bob-omb at the end.

4:26:05.760,4:26:11.340
The solution he came up with was the first 
use of squish cancel in the ABC. It made

4:26:11.340,4:26:15.479
use of both pendulums for the ending 
instead of just one. The far one was

4:26:15.479,4:26:18.719
used to get some height and dive to 
this moving bar, and the second was

4:26:18.720,4:26:23.640
used to squish cancel a dive recover to allow 
Mario to enter freefall. From a dive recover,

4:26:23.640,4:26:28.380
Mario can’t grab onto ledges, but from 
freefall, he can. This lets him grab

4:26:28.380,4:26:33.120
this ledge and reach the star in no A presses 
with no bob-omb, and therefore, no preset HOLP.

4:26:33.659,4:26:39.599
Now for the other two problems. Luckily, both 
of them can be solved the same way. Unluckily,

4:26:39.600,4:26:45.180
that way adds to the solution to get past the 
pole one extra thick layer of madness. Remember,

4:26:45.180,4:26:50.040
the bloated bob-omb used to cross the gap is one 
of the two bob-ombs found at the very bottom of

4:26:50.040,4:26:55.380
the stage. The solution to the two problems 
is to bring the other bob-omb past the pole.

4:26:55.380,4:26:59.880
The general idea of the route stays roughly 
the same, until it’s time to make the final

4:26:59.880,4:27:03.779
ascent. That’s when even more steps 
are needed to bring not just one,

4:27:03.779,4:27:08.340
but two bob-ombs up. First, there are 
a few explosion clones that need to be

4:27:08.340,4:27:11.939
set up for what’s coming up. Explosion 
clones function like you would expect:

4:27:11.939,4:27:16.319
when Mario collides with them, they knock him 
back and damage him, then they become intangible,

4:27:16.319,4:27:21.359
just like most other clones. Mario places 
one explosion clone over there, using BCA,

4:27:21.359,4:27:26.399
and three more right here. The first clone is a 
sacrifice so that the other two can be used later.

4:27:26.399,4:27:29.819
With that done, the HOLP is set up 
out of bounds on the moving bar,

4:27:29.819,4:27:34.500
and the first bob-omb is thrown there using 
BCA, where it will be held in place safely,

4:27:34.500,4:27:38.819
much to our convenience. Next, the HOLP 
is moved out of bounds using the clip

4:27:38.819,4:27:43.259
below the treadmill. This HOLP will be 
used to move both bob-ombs up the clock.

4:27:43.260,4:27:49.020
Now, Mario wants to grab the second bob-omb. 
Here, however, there is no other bob-omb whose

4:27:49.020,4:27:53.880
spawner can be conveniently used to bypass 
updating the HOLP. This is where the explosion

4:27:53.880,4:27:58.260
clones come into play: they allow the use of 
pause-buffered hitstun until a new invisible

4:27:58.260,4:28:03.720
object is able to be loaded into Mario’s hands: 
a star particle spawner. This takes a while,

4:28:03.720,4:28:08.340
which is why two active clones were needed: 
the first one to knock Mario back, and the

4:28:08.340,4:28:13.380
second one to extend his invincibility frames 
long enough to load the star particle spawner.

4:28:13.380,4:28:18.840
That spawner quickly unloads, so now, Mario is 
holding a vacant slot. Therefore, he needs to be

4:28:18.840,4:28:23.399
careful not to generate too much dust particles 
and other temporary objects that could load into

4:28:23.399,4:28:28.259
his hands and update the HOLP. Nonetheless, he 
climbs up the spinners and reaches these cubes.

4:28:28.260,4:28:34.680
He loads the bob-omb and drops it at the HOLP with 
BCA, just outside of the activation radius. This,

4:28:34.680,4:28:38.699
however, is an awkward position: it’s too 
low to be useful for the rest of the climb,

4:28:38.699,4:28:44.340
and too high to be worked with and dropped higher 
up. So, it needs to be lowered first. To do that,

4:28:44.340,4:28:47.819
Mario goes down to this walkway 
and enters the activation radius,

4:28:47.819,4:28:52.679
snapping the bob-omb to him. Then, he does a 
breakdance kick to get the bob-omb to explode,

4:28:52.680,4:28:57.000
and does instant release on it while 
it’s bloated at its maximum size. This

4:28:57.000,4:29:01.020
sends the bob-omb back to the HOLP, but 
this time, a bit lower, and a bit bigger.

4:29:01.020,4:29:06.359
The next step is to climb up to the moving hand 
but without reactivating the bob-omb. To do that,

4:29:06.359,4:29:11.519
Mario can simply ride the wild pendulum up 
to the hand. This climb just barely works:

4:29:11.520,4:29:16.920
Mario is less than one unit from clipping through 
the pendulum because it’s rising too fast. From

4:29:16.920,4:29:21.600
there, the other explosion clone comes in handy, 
to setup another pause-buffered hitstun. Mario

4:29:21.600,4:29:26.220
enters the bob-omb’s activation radius, grabs 
the bloated bomb and gets pushed off the hand,

4:29:26.220,4:29:30.120
where he drops it back to the HOLP, 
still bloated, but much higher this time.

4:29:30.120,4:29:34.439
Then, it’s back to the first bob-omb! 
Again, it’s dropped to the HOLP,

4:29:34.439,4:29:39.059
bloated as well, using instant release. The 
two bob-ombs end up very close together,

4:29:39.060,4:29:43.199
the first one slightly lower and 
the second one slightly higher.

4:29:43.199,4:29:48.120
After the squish cancel ground pound chain, 
it’s time to reactivate one bob-omb. The two

4:29:48.120,4:29:52.739
radii are very close together, and as it turns 
out, because it’s higher, the second bob-omb’s

4:29:52.739,4:29:57.000
radius is the one that Mario enters first. 
Therefore, that’s the one that gets reactivated,

4:29:57.000,4:30:01.380
and the other one is kept in place for now. 
This proves to be quite the problem, though,

4:30:01.380,4:30:06.479
because the range of motion is extremely limited. 
This time, when the bob-omb snaps to Mario, it

4:30:06.479,4:30:11.339
pushes him not completely inside the cage, because 
that would load the other bob-omb. Instead,

4:30:11.340,4:30:16.080
it pushes him between the two walls, where 
their combined push cancels out. While in there,

4:30:16.080,4:30:20.760
Mario has two frames where he’s able to move out 
of the way, until he exits the outside wall hitbox

4:30:20.760,4:30:25.920
and he completes the clip into the cage. At this 
point, he’s within one single unit of activating

4:30:25.920,4:30:30.779
the other bob-omb. Finally, he’s able to grab the 
bloated bob-omb and do the rest of the sequence.

4:30:30.779,4:30:35.819
After getting past the pole, he can retrieve the 
first bob-omb by entering its activation radius.

4:30:35.819,4:30:41.880
We’re almost done. From here, the bomb has two 
separate purposes. In The Pit and the Pendulums,

4:30:41.880,4:30:46.140
it’s used to replace the HOLP at the top of the 
pole before collecting the star, so that after

4:30:46.140,4:30:50.880
re-entering the clock, another star that gets 
past the pole can be done right away. The last

4:30:50.880,4:30:55.979
detail to consider for that star is that because 
it’s now down to 0 A presses, Mario can’t kick the

4:30:55.979,4:31:00.959
wall to recoil into the star and setup spawning 
displacement. So, a punch is used instead.

4:31:00.960,4:31:06.060
The principle is the same, but the execution 
proved to be a lot more difficult and precise.

4:31:06.060,4:31:11.040
In order to receive the recoil speed and touch 
the star on the same frame, a very specific

4:31:11.040,4:31:16.680
sequence of events needs to happen. First, Mario 
punches from on top of the pendulum’s shaft. Then,

4:31:16.680,4:31:21.300
he snaps down to the head. This is possible 
because when Mario is on the ground, he can

4:31:21.300,4:31:26.580
move from a higher floor to a lower floor by up 
to a hundred units at once. On the next frame,

4:31:26.580,4:31:30.720
Mario is on a float-precise seam between 
two walls, so he gets pushed by both.

4:31:30.720,4:31:35.159
This sends him next to the star and his 
punch connects with the wall. Finally,

4:31:35.159,4:31:40.019
he receives recoil and touches the star one frame 
later, and he falls with backwards momentum.

4:31:40.020,4:31:45.720
This specific set of conditions turned out 
to be nearly impossible. After making and

4:31:45.720,4:31:48.600
running a brute forcer to figure 
out a configuration that worked,

4:31:48.600,4:31:54.180
Pannenkoek found nothing. His closest attempt 
was just two units short of touching the star.

4:31:54.180,4:32:00.239
But after brainstorming new options with 
ds273, he finally found one single solution

4:32:00.239,4:32:03.960
that required a dive roll from the other 
pendulum to punch the wall with enough

4:32:03.960,4:32:09.239
speed. Note that the hand also needs to be in 
this precise spot to stop Mario from doing a

4:32:09.239,4:32:13.019
star dance clip on this platform instead, 
which would ruin the spawning displacement.

4:32:14.100,4:32:17.880
For Stomp on the Thwomp, the bob-omb is 
used, along with a slightly more complex

4:32:17.880,4:32:23.040
pendulum manipulation, to send Mario to the 
Pedro spot. This was the combined work of

4:32:23.040,4:32:28.560
ds273 and Pannenkoek. First, Mario goes 
up to the platform above the pendulums,

4:32:28.560,4:32:32.939
where he manipulates both of them at once. 
Then, he falls on top of the first pendulum,

4:32:32.939,4:32:37.919
reactivating the bob-omb. It pushes Mario into 
a spot just a little bit inside the ceiling,

4:32:37.920,4:32:42.960
like we’ve seen before. Mario walks in mid-air, 
stuck in the ceiling, and he’s moved around by the

4:32:42.960,4:32:47.880
bob-omb pushing him back. Once he gets into the 
Pedro spot, the rest of the strategy is very much

4:32:47.880,4:32:53.880
like the last Stomp on the Thwomp improvement. He 
gathers nearly 700 speed, then uses a double VSC

4:32:53.880,4:32:58.380
to reach all the way to the Thwomp and collect 
the star in a single A press. And this is how

4:32:58.380,4:33:03.600
Tick Tock Clock went from seven A presses down to 
only four, three of which are to enter the stage.

4:33:05.219,4:33:11.219
But this wouldn’t hold for very long. A new face 
in the community was concocting unusual plans.

4:33:11.219,4:33:15.779
He had been around for a few years, even 
contributing to the latest A press saves,

4:33:15.779,4:33:20.939
but nothing on the scale of what he was about 
to achieve. The complexity level was about to

4:33:20.939,4:33:26.099
get from the stratosphere to outer space 
thanks to one man. His name was Marbler.

4:33:36.959,4:33:41.279
On August 21st, Pannenkoek and Marbler 
completed their project of the past

4:33:41.279,4:33:46.500
couple of months. Together, they saved the 
final A press of Lethal Lava Land. They got

4:33:46.500,4:33:51.600
Elevator Tour in the Volcano in zero A 
presses, bringing the total count to 15.

4:33:52.260,4:33:57.180
First of all, why is this star problematic? 
Well, because of the final boss of the A

4:33:57.180,4:34:02.459
button challenge: a pole. There’s no way to 
get off this pole without falling down or

4:34:02.459,4:34:06.840
jumping. While it is possible to reach the 
other star in the volcano in no A presses,

4:34:06.840,4:34:11.100
the two platforms are too far apart and a 
long jump is required to cross that gap.

4:34:11.100,4:34:16.200
Instead, Mario will gain height another way, using 
a familiar method in a completely new context.

4:34:16.799,4:34:19.561
Let’s reminisce the mechanics 
of spawning displacement.

4:34:20.520,4:34:24.900
The reason it works is because Mario’s 
displacement by a moving platform is based

4:34:24.900,4:34:28.740
on its state at the end of the previous frame, 
effectively causing platforms to move Mario

4:34:28.740,4:34:34.320
for one extra frame after they should. If that 
displacement is rotational, when the new map loads

4:34:34.320,4:34:38.759
and the platform gets replaced with a new object, 
because Mario is very far from that new object,

4:34:38.760,4:34:43.080
the rotation is applied over a much longer 
distance and Mario is moved significantly.

4:34:43.080,4:34:48.180
Here, the concept is exactly the same, except that 
instead of a map transition creating a large gap,

4:34:48.180,4:34:54.240
Mario himself moves really far away in a single 
frame. Then, when the displacement is applied, the

4:34:54.240,4:34:59.820
rotation is very small, but the radius is so large 
that Mario is moved upwards substantially. Enough,

4:34:59.820,4:35:05.939
in fact, to end up above the star platform. In a 
parallel universe, that is. Because for Mario to

4:35:05.939,4:35:11.459
get displaced so much, he needs to have PU speed 
and move into a PU. Now the question becomes:

4:35:11.459,4:35:16.680
how can Mario be on a rotating platform on 
one frame, and in a PU on the next? This is

4:35:16.680,4:35:23.100
where things get complicated. To get our answer, 
let’s break down the 26-hour TAS step by step.

4:35:23.100,4:35:28.680
Mario begins by pushing a bully into the lava 
and running into it. This interrupts the death

4:35:28.680,4:35:33.119
animation of the bully, which leaves it stuck 
below the floor. Since there’s no more floor

4:35:33.119,4:35:37.260
under this, the bully is out of bounds. 
Just like the bob-omb in Tick Tock Clock,

4:35:37.260,4:35:41.039
it gets stuck alternating between 
two positions. As a sidenote,

4:35:41.039,4:35:45.660
for visual clarity, the bully will often 
be represented in a superposition. Just

4:35:45.660,4:35:49.980
keep in mind this isn’t actually the case: the 
bully is merely alternating between the two.

4:35:49.980,4:35:55.859
This state is particularly interesting because it 
keeps the bully’s speed frozen. Even though the

4:35:55.859,4:36:00.420
bully itself is out of bounds, its hitbox sticks 
out of the lava just enough that Mario can still

4:36:00.420,4:36:05.820
collide with it. If Mario runs into the bully 
perpendicularly to its movement, he transfers some

4:36:05.820,4:36:11.580
of his momentum to the bully, adding a tiny bit 
to its speed. This is called slow bully battery.

4:36:12.359,4:36:18.959
After doing this a few times, and by a few, I 
mean 31000 over 21 hours, the bully now has 4000

4:36:18.959,4:36:23.039
speed. We can do something with that, 
but first, we need to wait a few minutes.

4:36:23.039,4:36:31.980
In Super Mario 64, one full turn is 2 to the 
16, or 65536 angle units. So when the bully

4:36:31.980,4:36:36.179
is trying to move out of bounds and its movement 
is reversed, the game adds exactly half of that:

4:36:36.180,4:36:45.359
32767. Wait, 67? Yep! As it turns out, the angle 
added is one two-hundredth of a degree shy of half

4:36:45.359,4:36:51.660
a turn. This discrepancy is obviously completely 
meaningless. Unless you’re the ABC community.

4:36:51.660,4:36:56.459
While the bully is alternating between 
two positions, the angle at which it moves

4:36:56.459,4:37:01.980
slowly drifts over time. So slowly, in fact, 
that it takes over 36 minutes to do a full

4:37:01.980,4:37:06.718
rotation. Coincidentally, it’s also exactly 
the time it takes for the displacement angle

4:37:06.719,4:37:10.740
to exceed the 32-bit integer limit 
and overflow, causing a game crash.

4:37:10.740,4:37:15.599
But there’s an additional quirk that makes 
this even more interesting. When calculating

4:37:15.600,4:37:19.619
the displacement, the game truncates 
the angle to the nearest multiple of 16,

4:37:19.619,4:37:25.080
using what’s called hexadecimal angle units. 
Therefore, in practice, as the angle drifts,

4:37:25.080,4:37:31.500
the actual displacement only changes once every 
16 frames. Because 16 frames is an even number,

4:37:31.500,4:37:37.141
the angle change always happens while the bully is 
in one of its two possible positions. As a result,

4:37:37.141,4:37:42.299
this position acts as a pivot around which 
the other position rotates extremely slowly.

4:37:42.299,4:37:47.340
Choosing one position to act as the pivot is 
fairly simple: after colliding with Mario,

4:37:47.340,4:37:52.141
if the bully’s angle is even, its current 
position will be the pivot. If it’s odd, the

4:37:52.141,4:37:57.180
pivot will be the opposite. This means that while 
Pannenkoek was building up the bully’s speed,

4:37:57.180,4:38:03.119
every single one of the 31000 collisions had to 
result in an even angle. Using these pivots and

4:38:03.119,4:38:07.560
a lot of patience, you can get the bully to 
move into any convenient location you want.

4:38:07.561,4:38:12.539
Marbler uses this to get the bully into a nice 
spot for the next part, but first, he needs Mario

4:38:12.539,4:38:17.100
to be in a bit of a better shape. To climb the 
volcano up to the spinning heart, he gets some

4:38:17.100,4:38:21.959
coins for a lava boost, then gets this bully stuck 
in a corner and uses a dive roll knockback to

4:38:21.959,4:38:27.119
clear this ledge. This method will be used a few 
times to refill Mario’s health throughout the run.

4:38:27.719,4:38:30.180
When the bully has rotated 
around the pivot enough,

4:38:30.180,4:38:35.160
Mario runs into it so this position becomes 
the new pivot. This causes the other position

4:38:35.160,4:38:39.660
to start moving. The process is repeated a 
couple of times to move the bully around,

4:38:39.660,4:38:44.760
which takes about an hour. Now, Mario activates 
the elevator and rides it until it falls into

4:38:44.760,4:38:49.799
the lava. And on this frame, the first 
of many magic tricks: the bully appears.

4:38:49.799,4:38:55.020
Because the elevator is partly under the lava, 
this creates a floor for the bully to move

4:38:55.020,4:39:00.119
onto. So, instead of turning around, the bully 
does move to the elevator. On the next frame,

4:39:00.119,4:39:04.439
it moves onto the rock on the other side of 
the stage. Now, the bully is back in bounds,

4:39:04.439,4:39:07.980
but it’s going so fast that its next 
position is out of bounds. Again,

4:39:07.980,4:39:13.199
this reverses its direction and freezes its speed. 
On the next frame, the same thing happens and the

4:39:13.199,4:39:18.299
bully reverses back to its previous position. The 
result is therefore exactly the same as before,

4:39:18.299,4:39:22.561
even though the bully is now in bounds. 
Regardless of the bully’s current position,

4:39:22.561,4:39:26.641
so long as its next position would be 
out of bounds, it will behave this way.

4:39:27.299,4:39:30.779
Ten minutes of pivoting later, the 
bully is now in a perfect position

4:39:30.779,4:39:34.740
for the next part. You know, slow 
bully battery seems to imply the

4:39:34.740,4:39:39.660
existence of a fast bully battery. What 
does that look like? Well, don’t blink!

4:39:40.500,4:39:44.219
The bully now has over 6000 speed. What happened?

4:39:44.939,4:39:50.699
This time, Mario isn’t bullying the bully; the 
bully is bullying Mario. The collision angles are

4:39:50.699,4:39:56.039
reversed: the bully is mostly perpendicular and 
Mario is parallel to the collision tangent. In

4:39:56.039,4:40:01.680
this scenario, the bully actually transfers three 
times its momentum to Mario. This isn’t a bug,

4:40:01.680,4:40:06.779
it’s an intentional feature to give bullies a 
bit more punch to their attack. Normally, this

4:40:06.779,4:40:11.099
wouldn’t be an issue because Mario’s knockback 
speed is capped to 32, but, as you may have

4:40:11.100,4:40:17.219
guessed, this isn’t a normal scenario. This is 
the original textbook use case for squish cancel.

4:40:17.879,4:40:22.980
The edge of the elevator has an exposed ceiling 
because of a rounding error, and it’s a dynamic

4:40:22.980,4:40:27.900
surface. Mario enters the bully’s hitbox 
to get knocked back. On the next frame,

4:40:27.900,4:40:33.000
first, the elevator displaces Mario into the 
exposed slanted ceiling, squishing him. Then,

4:40:33.000,4:40:38.699
the bully collision moves Mario out and gives him 
triple the bully’s momentum, or just shy of 10000

4:40:38.699,4:40:43.920
speed. Before the game processes the knockback 
speed cap, the squish push, now disjointed

4:40:43.920,4:40:48.420
because of the bully collision, moves Mario 
here, where he ends the frame. Since he left

4:40:48.420,4:40:52.920
the ceiling and the elevator, the squish cancel 
is complete. Mario still has his high speed,

4:40:52.920,4:40:57.900
but he’s no longer being knocked back; he’s 
now idle. Therefore, the speed is preserved.

4:40:57.900,4:41:03.539
On the next frame, the elevator moves back under 
Mario, so instead of entering freefall, Mario is

4:41:03.539,4:41:08.820
still on the ground. At the same time, Mario moves 
for one single quarterstep to the other end of

4:41:08.820,4:41:13.920
the stage. Because he’s still on the ground, he 
can snap down to a floor up to 100 units lower;

4:41:13.920,4:41:19.260
82 units in this case. This is important because 
when Mario tries to move out of bounds, his speed

4:41:19.260,4:41:24.119
is only conserved if he’s on the ground. If he’s 
in the air, the speed is immediately set to 0.

4:41:24.119,4:41:28.560
Meanwhile, the bully, after this collision, 
does lose a significant amount of its speed,

4:41:28.561,4:41:34.260
but it still has 1100. This is low enough to 
actually move inside the level. Over the next

4:41:34.260,4:41:38.580
few frames, it bounces around, skipping over 
Mario and bouncing back on out of bounds until

4:41:38.580,4:41:43.980
Mario hits it again. That transfers Mario’s 
new speed back to the bully. The important

4:41:43.980,4:41:48.179
element of this interaction is the momentum 
being tripled when the bully knocks Mario

4:41:48.180,4:41:53.039
away. This breaks the usual conservation 
of energy. Just before the collision,

4:41:53.039,4:41:58.619
the bully had 2500 speed. A third of it was lost 
during the two frames the bully spent moving

4:41:58.619,4:42:04.439
in bounds earlier. After Mario transfers 
his speed back, the bully now has 6600.

4:42:04.439,4:42:07.798
The only caveat of this trick 
is that it’s impossibly precise:

4:42:07.799,4:42:11.459
the elevator needs to send Mario into 
a unit precise exposed ceiling and

4:42:11.459,4:42:15.420
the bully needs to somehow collide with 
Mario again soon after. In other words,

4:42:15.420,4:42:20.279
Marbler was trying to hit a pea with a pool shot 
where the balls are moving at escape velocity.

4:42:20.279,4:42:25.080
Nonetheless, fast bully batteries can be 
chained together, allowing Mario and the

4:42:25.080,4:42:30.420
bully to exchange exponentially large speeds to 
each other. After the first one, though, things do

4:42:30.420,4:42:36.840
get a bit simpler. First, the bully collides with 
Mario at 6000 speed. This leaves Mario with 20000

4:42:36.840,4:42:42.600
speed, conserved using squish cancel, and the 
bully with 4000 speed and an odd angle. Therefore,

4:42:42.600,4:42:46.260
the pivot is far out of bounds and 
the bully slowly rotates back into

4:42:46.260,4:42:51.420
Mario. Mario transfers all of his speed 
again, leaving the bully with 15000 speed.

4:42:51.420,4:42:57.600
This process is done a total of 6 times, roughly 
tripling the speeds involved each time. However,

4:42:57.600,4:43:02.340
because the collision angles need to be somewhat 
precise and their positions extremely precise,

4:43:02.340,4:43:07.799
this turned out to be a very complex logistical 
problem. After one fast bully battery,

4:43:07.799,4:43:12.660
the bully often needs to rotate to a completely 
different angle for the next one. Sometimes,

4:43:12.660,4:43:16.980
the bully itself needs to be moved using 
alternating pivots to set up a viable position

4:43:16.980,4:43:22.619
for squish cancel. Marbler had to figure out 
a way to move the bully around at PU speeds,

4:43:22.619,4:43:27.299
but never letting it cross a valid position 
in a parallel universe. Doing that would

4:43:27.299,4:43:32.160
lose the bully into the void forever. He 
carefully planned out a series of speeds

4:43:32.160,4:43:36.180
and rotations that would never cross 
a PU throughout the entire process.

4:43:37.320,4:43:42.718
At PU speeds, when the pivot is tens of thousands 
of units away, what used to be an imperceptible

4:43:42.719,4:43:48.240
rotation is now pretty obvious. This actually 
becomes a problem at even higher speeds.

4:43:48.240,4:43:53.638
Moving the bully using a pivot becomes impractical 
because the in-bounds position moves too fast for

4:43:53.639,4:43:57.900
Mario to keep up with it, and you can’t simply 
wait out a full rotation when that would crash

4:43:57.900,4:44:04.019
the game. The last three fast bully batteries all 
need to be done without moving the bully. Also,

4:44:04.020,4:44:07.859
the second to last one has to be done 
within 5 frames or Mario would get

4:44:07.859,4:44:12.359
squished by another exposed ceiling, which 
was another nightmare for Marbler to solve.

4:44:12.359,4:44:17.638
In this three-hour ordeal, the bully comes 
dangerously close to a PU more times than

4:44:17.639,4:44:23.939
we can count, and ultimately runs into 
Mario at 847000 speed. This gives Mario

4:44:23.939,4:44:29.820
3.4 million speed. And now, Mario is ready 
to take an elevator ride out of this world.

4:44:29.820,4:44:35.279
But this is actually a bit more complex. For the 
elevator to keep affecting Mario for a frame,

4:44:35.279,4:44:40.439
Mario needs to actually be on it. Not only does 
Mario need to go to a PU in a single frame,

4:44:40.439,4:44:46.080
he needs to trick the elevator into thinking 
he hasn’t moved at all! How does he do that?

4:44:46.080,4:44:50.879
Simple: by moving to a point in a PU that 
corresponds to the elevator in the real map.

4:44:50.879,4:44:55.500
Except it wasn’t simple, it was actually a 
total nightmare with a million workarounds

4:44:55.500,4:44:58.859
that barely work for all these reasons 
that you can pause to read if you want.

4:44:58.859,4:45:03.959
Finally, after Mario moves from the elevator in 
the main map to the same elevator but in a PU,

4:45:03.959,4:45:08.760
on the next frame, the elevator still thinks Mario 
is standing on it and rotates ever so slightly.

4:45:08.760,4:45:13.619
This rotational displacement, when magnified 
over a distance of 52 parallel universes,

4:45:13.619,4:45:18.060
sends Mario almost 4000 units 
upwards, well above the star platform.

4:45:18.660,4:45:23.459
The conditions for this are quite precise, 
considering Mario needs to stay in bounds. The

4:45:23.459,4:45:27.840
maximum vertical displacement achievable when 
the elevator is in this state is quite small,

4:45:27.840,4:45:32.039
which is why Pannen and Marbler had 
to settle for an insane distance to

4:45:32.039,4:45:37.560
magnify it over. This causes the horizontal 
displacement to be problematic. There was no

4:45:37.561,4:45:42.719
way to have the elevator move Mario up far 
enough without also flinging him far out of

4:45:42.719,4:45:48.119
bounds. They solved this problem by making 
the elevator move Mario an entire PU over.

4:45:48.119,4:45:54.119
Now, Mario is a bit too high: about 500 units 
above the star platform. To correct that,

4:45:54.119,4:45:59.459
after a bit of speed adjustment, Pannenkoek had 
to make Mario fall down quite a bit. That fall

4:45:59.459,4:46:06.719
takes 20 frames and moves Mario by 975 parallel 
universes. And now, all that’s left is to navigate

4:46:06.719,4:46:15.660
back in bounds. Pannenkoek moves 624 PUs in the 
X axis and 96 on the Z axis, and finally, 352 PUs

4:46:15.660,4:46:23.160
X and 44 PUs Z, back to the main map. Collecting 
the star is trivial. Reaching the star… was not.

4:46:24.539,4:46:30.900
Let’s back up a bit on the timeline, to April 
19th, 2022. Tick Tock Clock’s triple A press save

4:46:30.900,4:46:35.939
was being heavily worked on, and it was looking 
more and more likely by the day. On that night,

4:46:35.939,4:46:41.279
ds273 and Marbler were in a voice chat. 
The subject of Stomp on the Thwomp soon

4:46:41.279,4:46:47.160
being down to a single A press came up. What 
about saving that last A press? Marbler and

4:46:47.160,4:46:53.279
ds273 were laughing at even suggesting such a 
thing. First of all, that jump is probably the

4:46:53.279,4:46:58.500
single A press that gets the most work done. It 
skips going up these boxes, these treadmills,

4:46:58.500,4:47:03.061
and of course, the thwomp itself. They had 
no star dance clip left, no preset HOLP,

4:47:03.061,4:47:08.520
no pendulums, and one bob-omb from all the way 
at the bottom of the clock. Needless to say,

4:47:08.520,4:47:11.939
it was never going to happen and 
they had a good laugh about it.

4:47:11.939,4:47:17.339
The next day, Marbler set out to demonstrate how 
infeasible this idea was by going through each

4:47:17.340,4:47:22.260
step and showing precisely why it couldn’t be 
done. He came to the conclusion that in total,

4:47:22.260,4:47:27.180
there were eight problematic points. Two 
here, two here, three here, and finally,

4:47:27.180,4:47:32.100
getting on top of the thwomp. Most of these could 
theoretically be solved with a star dance clip,

4:47:32.100,4:47:36.420
but proving that is useless; you 
can’t just spawn seven 100-coin stars.

4:47:36.420,4:47:41.400
But then, Marbler looked closer at each 
failure point, and the closer he looked,

4:47:41.400,4:47:46.320
the more answers he found. First, the pole 
platform, which uses the only available

4:47:46.320,4:47:51.718
star dance clip. This in itself is a problem, 
because it means the method to get past the pole,

4:47:51.719,4:47:57.900
with its use of a star and a fire clone, is a one 
time use. For a 0 A press strategy to have any

4:47:57.900,4:48:02.400
kind of a chance of being possible, there would 
need to be a way to climb up and down the pole to

4:48:02.400,4:48:08.099
set up HOLPs for cloning. It was time for Mario 
to do away with non-renewable height sources.

4:48:08.100,4:48:12.840
This is the crux of the issue. With the 
amount of obstacles on the way up the clock,

4:48:12.840,4:48:16.561
the problem becomes very similar to 
what Bowser in the Sky used to be:

4:48:16.561,4:48:22.619
a very long deconstructed goomba bridge. Except, 
this time, it was bob-ombs, coins and fire clones,

4:48:22.619,4:48:27.480
and this time, instead of casually walking around 
Bowser in the Sky, every single step involved

4:48:27.480,4:48:33.900
repeating the madness-inducing nonsense to get 
past the pole in no A presses. Every single time.

4:48:34.680,4:48:39.180
The elevator platform could theoretically 
be reached from below using a dive recover,

4:48:39.180,4:48:44.699
a fire bounce and a misalignment. Unfortunately, 
despite this wall having an open corner, it’s not

4:48:44.699,4:48:49.320
pointing away from the origin, therefore 
no misalignment exists. But if instead,

4:48:49.320,4:48:53.340
a bloated bob-omb could snap to Mario’s 
position and push him into that corner,

4:48:53.340,4:48:57.959
it could possibly push him completely through 
the wall hitboxes and into the floor beyond.

4:48:57.959,4:49:05.820
This diagonal is 141 units. A maximum size 
bloated bob-omb pushes Mario by 149 units.

4:49:05.820,4:49:11.279
On paper, this could actually work. In 
practice, well, that’s another story.

4:49:11.279,4:49:15.779
Where would that bob-omb that magically 
snaps to Mario’s position even come from?

4:49:15.779,4:49:20.519
The 4000-unit sphere would need to 
intersect this minuscule spot in a

4:49:20.520,4:49:24.959
way that Mario can enter it here without 
touching it at any earlier time. But also,

4:49:24.959,4:49:30.539
what bob-omb would that even be? Currently, 
the only two bob-ombs are already in use. Well,

4:49:30.539,4:49:35.639
it turns out both of these questions can be 
answered at once using pause-buffered hitstun.

4:49:35.639,4:49:41.219
When Mario grabs a bob-omb, it’s always placed 100 
units in front of Mario, regardless of where the

4:49:41.219,4:49:47.340
HOLP is. This allows Mario to do a bob-omb glide 
despite the HOLP still being disjointed. This

4:49:47.340,4:49:52.859
comes within one frame of failing, but it does 
get Mario across without updating the HOLP. Then,

4:49:52.859,4:49:57.298
the bob-omb is released back to the HOLP, which, 
remember, is out of bounds across the clock.

4:49:57.299,4:50:03.600
By some absolute miracle, with a very slight 
modification to its exact position, the same

4:50:03.600,4:50:08.639
HOLP used to cross this gap and to retrieve 
the bob-omb past the pole can also perfectly

4:50:08.639,4:50:14.039
intersect this open corner. This lets Mario 
reuse the same bob-omb to get pushed completely

4:50:14.039,4:50:18.840
past the wall hitboxes and into the floor 
hitbox, bypassing the use of star dance clip.

4:50:18.840,4:50:24.480
This groundbreaking discovery had two huge 
implications: first, the star dance clip

4:50:24.480,4:50:28.560
was freed up to be used somewhere else, 
higher up in the clock. But crucially,

4:50:28.561,4:50:33.180
there was now nothing preventing Mario from 
making multiple trips up and down the pole.

4:50:33.180,4:50:38.100
Well, almost nothing. There were 
just five little hurdles to get over.

4:50:38.699,4:50:43.138
First, Mario also needs a repeatable 
way of getting off the pole. Thankfully,

4:50:43.139,4:50:47.820
after the first trip up, he can lure this Heave 
Ho to get stuck in just the right spot to have

4:50:47.820,4:50:52.619
it fling Mario from the pole directly 
onto the elevator above. How convenient!

4:50:53.219,4:50:58.680
Now for the second problem. The setup to clip 
this corner was extremely precise and required

4:50:58.680,4:51:04.260
a fire clone, but remember, fire clones can only 
be interacted with once. Each trip up the pole

4:51:04.260,4:51:08.699
adds one more fire clone, and they all need to 
be in different positions for Mario to be able

4:51:08.699,4:51:13.619
to touch them individually. Contrarily to goombas 
which can be as close to each other as possible,

4:51:13.619,4:51:18.840
fire clones need to be at least 37 units 
away from each other to be usable. The

4:51:18.840,4:51:22.920
elevator can only take up a limited set 
of positions, so the possible heights

4:51:22.920,4:51:27.000
Mario could achieve were also limited 
in the same way. All things considered,

4:51:27.000,4:51:31.320
a maximum of 21 trips up the pole were 
theoretically possible with this method.

4:51:31.320,4:51:36.060
The third issue was between he HOLP and the 
squish cancel ground pound chain. Remember,

4:51:36.061,4:51:41.520
the old position was just barely far enough away 
to allow for the strategy to be possible in the

4:51:41.520,4:51:48.600
first place. Sadly, this new required HOLP was 
incompatible. It prompted SJMHRP to revisit the

4:51:48.600,4:51:53.520
squish cancel ground pound chain and find a 
completely new method. And the one she found

4:51:53.520,4:51:58.080
was not only compatible with the new HOLP, it 
was also a lot simpler to set up and repeat.

4:51:58.080,4:52:03.600
The fourth headache was between the HOLP and 
the instant release at the moving bar. The new

4:52:03.600,4:52:08.760
HOLP was also incompatible with this part, since 
it barely overlapped with the entire moving bar.

4:52:08.760,4:52:13.920
This one was fixed with a clever use of BCA 
right at the edge of the activation radius.

4:52:13.920,4:52:18.600
Finally, the thing with fire clones is that 
while they can give Mario additional height,

4:52:18.600,4:52:23.520
they do so at the cost of his health. As of 
now, getting all the way up to the pole cost

4:52:23.520,4:52:29.459
Mario 11 health sectors, way above the maximum 
survivable damage of 7. While theoretically,

4:52:29.459,4:52:34.139
coin clones could be used along the way to refill 
some of that missing health, they would need at

4:52:34.139,4:52:39.539
least 4 per trip, which would be unbelievably 
annoying to set up. But SJMHRP’s improvement

4:52:39.539,4:52:44.400
to the squish cancel ground pound chain also 
took down the damage Mario takes from 6 to 2,

4:52:44.400,4:52:48.660
meaning that Mario could live through this 
climb without a single coin for extra health.

4:52:49.500,4:52:53.400
Now, the bob-omb used past the pole 
in Stomp on the Thwomp’s 1 A press

4:52:53.400,4:52:57.480
strategy could be repurposed for other 
things higher up in the clock. However,

4:52:57.480,4:53:01.798
at its current height, the 4000-unit 
radius ends up short. So, the bob-omb

4:53:01.799,4:53:05.639
needs to be moved up while staying 
out of bounds. But here’s a problem:

4:53:05.639,4:53:10.320
Mario needs to enter the activation radius to 
snap the bob-omb to him, then he needs to be

4:53:10.320,4:53:15.000
out of the 4000-unit cylinder to release the 
bob-omb back to the HOLP at this new height.

4:53:15.000,4:53:21.000
How can he go all the way from here to there? 
Certainly not with Behind Camera Anywhere, but

4:53:21.000,4:53:27.600
maybe with pause-buffered hitstun. But even PBH 
ends up way too short. Enter the Hitstun Highway.

4:53:27.600,4:53:32.820
This series of explosion clones creates 
a path for Mario to extend his hitstun

4:53:32.820,4:53:37.740
timer all the way across the clock and exit the 
activation radius before releasing the bob-omb

4:53:37.740,4:53:44.400
without ever updating the HOLP. Another problem 
solved. And now a new problem is created. To get

4:53:44.400,4:53:49.439
from the elevator to Timed Jumps on Moving Bars, 
usually, a Heave Ho flip bypassed the whole thing.

4:53:49.439,4:53:54.779
But if it has to be stuck here, Mario needs a 
new way to get from here to there. Thankfully,

4:53:54.779,4:53:59.400
a simple misalignment on the corner of this 
platform gets the job done. Except it doesn’t,

4:53:59.400,4:54:03.359
because that would reactivate the 
bob-omb we’ve just moved. Instead,

4:54:03.359,4:54:08.099
another fire clone has to be used. For 
multiple trips, a string of fire clones.

4:54:08.100,4:54:13.619
The next failure point was these cubes, which 
were decidedly too far apart to ascend. However,

4:54:13.619,4:54:15.779
there is an alternative to navigating those:

4:54:15.779,4:54:20.400
reaching the top of this cage and diving 
across. Unfortunately, that’s not easy either,

4:54:20.400,4:54:25.619
but it is possible with fire bounces. Oh, and 
a second chain of squish cancel ground pounds

4:54:25.619,4:54:30.840
on this pendulum that comes within a single unit 
of reactivating the bob-omb early. No big deal.

4:54:30.840,4:54:35.820
The final ground pound is actually pretty 
significant. While Mario is in the ascending

4:54:35.820,4:54:40.080
part of the ground pound, quarterstep collisions 
are not calculated, which is how he can clip

4:54:40.080,4:54:44.639
through platforms sometimes. Regardless, another 
collision check is also made at the start of the

4:54:44.639,4:54:50.219
frame. But there’s a key difference in the hitbox 
shape used for those checks: instead of using the

4:54:50.219,4:54:55.680
air movement hitboxes, it uses the ground movement 
hitbox, which is narrower at the top. Because it’s

4:54:55.680,4:55:00.600
narrower, it happens to miss Mario on this frame. 
On the next frame, because the moving bar is

4:55:00.600,4:55:06.119
springing out fast enough, the hitbox skips over 
Mario entirely. As Mario starts to fall back down,

4:55:06.119,4:55:10.920
he meets the side of the moving bar, which pushes 
him out. But because that would push him into a

4:55:10.920,4:55:15.959
ceiling, the movement is canceled and Mario stays 
put. After collisions with walls are handled,

4:55:15.959,4:55:19.980
collisions with floors are next on the list, 
so Mario lands on top of the moving bar.

4:55:19.980,4:55:25.560
To get up on this walkway though, there was no 
misalignment. It wasn’t anywhere near the bob-omb

4:55:25.561,4:55:31.139
activation radius. There was nothing to work with. 
This is where the star dance clip would have to

4:55:31.139,4:55:36.359
be used. Which means, everything further up can 
only be accessed once, so better make it count.

4:55:36.359,4:55:42.119
And make it count, Marbler did. The first 
treadmill step can be approached in two

4:55:42.119,4:55:47.879
different ways. The first is somehow getting 
324 units of height to reach a misalignment,

4:55:47.879,4:55:52.980
which can only be done with a star dance clip. The 
second is to reach it from the walkway instead,

4:55:52.980,4:55:57.359
which is just a little bit too far away to 
be possible. But what about this bob-omb

4:55:57.359,4:56:01.019
that we placed out of bounds at around 
the height of the pole? You guessed it:

4:56:01.020,4:56:06.840
its activation radius just so happens to now be 
perfectly placed to snap the bob-omb back to Mario

4:56:06.840,4:56:11.639
right here, which pushes him into the one unit 
misalignment and snaps him up to the treadmill.

4:56:11.639,4:56:16.680
Then, Mario does a quick turn. When the stick 
is held in a direction different than the one

4:56:16.680,4:56:21.480
Mario is looking in, he slowly turns until 
he matches that new angle. But if instead,

4:56:21.480,4:56:27.359
Mario is walking and comes to a complete stop, 
he can then turn in any direction instantly. So,

4:56:27.359,4:56:30.480
this is what happens: Mario lands 
with the stick at a neutral position,

4:56:30.480,4:56:35.099
which stops his momentum. Then, he walks 
at the minimum stick range for one frame,

4:56:35.100,4:56:40.260
comes to a stop, and instantly turns around. 
This allows him to turn around in only 4 frames,

4:56:40.260,4:56:44.879
instead of up to 16, which in turn lets him grab 
the bob-omb before it falls out of his grasp.

4:56:44.879,4:56:50.699
Now for the final treadmill, which again, is 
simply too high. To have any chance of getting up,

4:56:50.699,4:56:56.459
Marbler had to think outside the box, where he 
found one sliver of hope: the spinners. The height

4:56:56.459,4:57:01.619
difference from here to there is just barely 
within reason, but could this gap be cleared?

4:57:01.619,4:57:07.260
Well, of course it can, with a bob-omb glide! The 
problem, though, is that the bob-omb is so bloated

4:57:07.260,4:57:12.900
that Mario ends up completely overshooting it. 
The spinner is also still a bit too high to reach

4:57:12.900,4:57:18.119
without the extra help from stored vertical speed. 
So, instead, Marbler waits out the fuse timer,

4:57:18.119,4:57:22.379
then regrabs the bob-omb as it’s about to 
explode, when it’s slightly less bloated.

4:57:22.379,4:57:28.260
This turned out to be a bit of a tricky maneuver. 
First, Mario gets pushed off the treadmill, so he

4:57:28.260,4:57:33.299
dives back on. On the next frame, he does a dive 
recover, which has to be pause buffered because

4:57:33.299,4:57:38.459
it’s another B press on two consecutive frames. 
Because the end of the treadmill is so steep,

4:57:38.459,4:57:44.459
after one quarterstep, Mario immediately lands 
again, which stores a vertical speed of 26. On

4:57:44.459,4:57:48.900
the next frame, he does a standing punch, which 
also has to be pause buffered because it’s yet

4:57:48.900,4:57:54.359
another B press. This establishes the bob-omb as 
the target of a grab, but because it’s a standing

4:57:54.359,4:57:59.279
punch, Mario doesn’t quite grab the bob-omb yet. 
At the same time, he gets pushed back off the

4:57:59.279,4:58:04.138
treadmill by the now expanding bob-omb, which 
reactivates his conserved 26 vertical speed.

4:58:04.139,4:58:10.139
On the next frame, Mario does a pause buffered 
dive, the fourth B press on consecutive frames.

4:58:10.139,4:58:15.240
This makes him grab the bob-omb instantly, because 
it’s already the target of a grab, and also makes

4:58:15.240,4:58:20.760
him land on the treadmill again, this time with 22 
vertical speed. At this point, the bob-omb pushes

4:58:20.760,4:58:25.680
Mario back off the treadmill, where he enters 
freefall while hands free holding. His stored

4:58:25.680,4:58:30.840
vertical speed carries him up and a ground pound 
covers the rest. But it’s just not quite enough

4:58:30.840,4:58:36.119
to land square on the spinner. That’s a handful 
of units too far to reach, because the side wall

4:58:36.119,4:58:41.459
of the spinner prevents landing on the corner. At 
least, it would, except there’s a sliver of floor

4:58:41.459,4:58:46.320
one unit wide sticking out of the wall hitbox, 
which allows Mario to land safely on the spinner.

4:58:46.320,4:58:50.340
Staying on the spinner is also a 
bit tricky, but it is doable thanks

4:58:50.340,4:58:54.299
to the bob-omb still pushing Mario back and 
keeping him on the steep slope long enough.

4:58:54.900,4:58:58.500
After this section, the rest is 
a piece of cake until the Thwomp.

4:59:02.340,4:59:12.719
Here, the bob-omb is used to get a fire 
clone by the Thwomp using BCA. Thankfully,

4:59:12.719,4:59:15.359
there is another fire spitter 
right at the top of the clock,

4:59:15.359,4:59:19.740
so no need to go all the way down for it. 
Besides, remember, there’s no turning back

4:59:19.740,4:59:24.299
after using the star dance clip. But the real 
problem here is that the flame clone needs

4:59:24.299,4:59:28.320
to be higher than the highest point where 
Mario can set the HOLP or release a clone.

4:59:28.320,4:59:34.799
This was solved by ds273 and Marbler using a wild 
combination of object slot manipulation magic and

4:59:34.799,4:59:39.719
the jagged diagonal of the treadmill’s floor to 
get in a hands free holding state. That still

4:59:39.719,4:59:44.100
wasn’t enough, because while they could get Mario 
a bit higher up with a ground pound, he couldn’t

4:59:44.100,4:59:50.820
release an object, and therefore place the HOLP, 
until after he landed. That is until ds273 had the

4:59:50.820,4:59:57.119
idea of using BCA not just to release the clone, 
but to set the HOLP itself. By forcing Mario to go

4:59:57.119,5:00:02.279
off camera during the ground pound, the HOLP stops 
updating at this point, so it remains up there.

5:00:02.279,5:00:07.799
And finally, the last magic trick: a dive 
recover VSC into a ground pound squish

5:00:07.799,5:00:12.840
cancel fire bounce to reach a misalignment 
on the corner of the Thwomp. This is not

5:00:12.840,5:00:17.459
like a regular misalignment. Instead, 
it exists because the wall is ever so

5:00:17.459,5:00:22.080
slightly slanted sideways, creating a one 
unit gap in its corner at certain heights.

5:00:22.619,5:00:27.719
Now, repeatedly burning Mario to clear gaps 
takes its toll on the poor plumber. Thankfully,

5:00:27.719,5:00:32.520
there are two spinning hearts in Tick-Tock Clock, 
but despite all the best efforts to minimize the

5:00:32.520,5:00:38.219
burning damage, Mario comes within one sixteenth 
of a sector of health of dying. On top of that,

5:00:38.219,5:00:42.480
four coin clones are used to refill 
some health. Setting all of this up

5:00:42.480,5:00:47.939
requires multiple trips up and down the clock 
to place all of these clones. How many, exactly?

5:00:48.600,5:00:53.760
Five trips to set up enough fire clones at this 
elevator for the rest of the route. Two trips

5:00:53.760,5:00:58.439
to set up the explosion clones for the bob-omb 
glide under pause-buffered hitstun. Two trips

5:00:58.439,5:01:03.240
to set up the explosion clones for the hitstun 
highway. Two trips for the flame clones to get

5:01:03.240,5:01:08.699
off this elevator. Two trips for the flame clones 
needed to get up on this cage, and coin clones to

5:01:08.699,5:01:14.279
refill Mario’s health. One trip for the flame 
and coin clones on top of the cage. One trip to

5:01:14.279,5:01:19.679
set up a coin and a fire clone for the star dance 
clip. One more trip to set up a flame clone here,

5:01:19.680,5:01:23.820
because the way the bob-omb is sent to the out 
of bounds HOLP for the last time prevents Mario

5:01:23.820,5:01:28.980
from manipulating the Heave Ho into throwing 
him directly on the elevator. It’s possible

5:01:28.980,5:01:35.580
to get on the elevator with at least 128 units 
of height, excluding 128. A dive recover gives

5:01:35.580,5:01:41.699
Mario precisely 128 units of height, so it’s not 
enough, hence the use of one more fire clone.

5:01:41.699,5:01:47.580
And finally, a seventeenth trip up the clock 
where Mario sets up two bob-ombs out of bounds.

5:01:47.580,5:01:53.400
He climbs up with a squish cancel ground pound 
chain. He snaps one bob-omb to his position and

5:01:53.400,5:01:58.500
crosses the gap under pause buffered hitstun 
to avoid updating the HOLP. He climbs up to

5:01:58.500,5:02:03.119
the pole by snapping that same bob-omb to him 
again and clipping into the floor of the pole

5:02:03.119,5:02:08.820
platform. He snaps the other bob-omb to him and 
uses a pause-buffered hitstun highway to carry it

5:02:08.820,5:02:13.980
across the map without updating the out of bounds 
HOLP. He gets flung next to the elevator and flame

5:02:13.980,5:02:20.160
bounces onto it. He hits another fire clone to 
cross this gap. He rides this pendulum up, does

5:02:20.160,5:02:25.799
a final squish cancel ground pound chain up to the 
cage, flame bounces up to the top. He star dance

5:02:25.799,5:02:31.020
clips to this walkway. Snaps the bob-omb to him 
one last time to get on the treadmill, then glides

5:02:31.020,5:02:35.879
into a misalignment on this spinner. He carries 
that bob-omb all the way to the top, where,

5:02:35.879,5:02:41.879
using hands free holding and BCA, he sets up the 
HOLP for one last little bit of cloning. Finally,

5:02:41.879,5:02:47.279
he completes the star with VSC, a ground pound 
squish cancel, a fire bounce and a misalignment to

5:02:47.279,5:02:54.240
get on top of the Thwomp. At last, Tick Tock Clock 
is A press free. Tick Tock Clock is conquered.

5:02:55.740,5:03:01.320
At least, on paper. Every piece of the puzzle 
has been figured out and proven possible, but

5:03:01.320,5:03:06.240
an A press save is only truly proven when there 
is a proper TAS that pieces it all together in

5:03:06.240,5:03:13.799
one fluid motion. This unbelievably complex task 
is, as always, given to pannenkoek2012. This time,

5:03:13.799,5:03:18.299
though, he isn’t doing it all alone: 
SJMHRP and Marbler join him as well.

5:03:18.299,5:03:23.879
SJMHRP’s specialty was the 17 squish cancel 
ground pound chains on the lower pendulum.

5:03:23.879,5:03:28.680
Pannenkoek dealt with everything in the lower 
part of the clock, which came out to be most of

5:03:28.680,5:03:34.619
the work. Marbler took care of the upper section, 
taking over after SJMHRP, and handing back the TAS

5:03:34.619,5:03:40.560
to Pannenkoek whenever Mario had to go back down 
to set up more clones. Very little of the TASing

5:03:40.561,5:03:45.660
process could be automated. Aside from pendulum 
manipulation and a couple of repeated processes,

5:03:45.660,5:03:51.119
nearly all of this 6-hour TAS was painstakingly 
created frame by frame, which took in the ballpark

5:03:51.119,5:03:58.500
of 180 hours and over 160,000 rerecords. The 
team ran into an issue with the preset HOLP that

5:03:58.500,5:04:03.240
threatened nearly the entire first half of the 
work, but they managed to miraculously salvage it.

5:04:03.240,5:04:07.439
The theorycrafting of the route was done 
in parallel to the work on the three A

5:04:07.439,5:04:12.539
press saves from July. Work on the TAS began 
soon after Lethal Lava Land was finished,

5:04:12.539,5:04:18.000
in mid-September. It was finally completed on 
October 27th, and published two weeks later,

5:04:18.000,5:04:25.680
on November 13th, 2022. As of today, there 
are 14 A presses left in Super Mario 64.

5:04:25.680,5:04:32.219
So, what are those 14 A presses and how could 
we save them? First, let’s look at the famous

5:04:32.219,5:04:37.680
A presses to enter Tick Tock Clock. With three 
spawning displacement strategies allowing for

5:04:37.680,5:04:42.240
a re-entry without using A, Tick Tock Clock now 
needs to be entered three times from the floor.

5:04:42.240,5:04:49.740
The prospect of adding more spawning displacements 
is quite grim. It just does not seem possible. But

5:04:49.740,5:04:54.599
even if it was, Tick Tock Clock already requires 
three different preset HOLPs that can’t be set

5:04:54.600,5:04:59.699
within the stage itself. Each entry that requires 
an A press sets the HOLP somewhere else before

5:04:59.699,5:05:04.320
entering the stage, so adding another spawning 
displacement would disrupt this fine balance.

5:05:04.320,5:05:10.320
So, what other options are there? Well, in 
this room of the castle, not that many. The

5:05:10.320,5:05:14.759
level entrance is pretty high up, so there’s no 
hope to ever get up directly from the floor to

5:05:14.760,5:05:20.400
the clock in no A presses. That’s not even 
close. The only possible avenue would be to

5:05:20.400,5:05:24.839
reach it from the path to Bowser in the Sky. 
Unfortunately, to have any chance of that,

5:05:24.840,5:05:30.480
Mario would need at least about 90 speed. With 
nothing useful to work with, that’s well beyond

5:05:30.480,5:05:35.638
the maximum speed attainable. For now, these 
three A presses are looking pretty solid.

5:05:35.639,5:05:40.799
Similarly, also in this room is a pair of 
twin A presses: one to go to Rainbow Ride,

5:05:40.799,5:05:44.760
and one to go to Wing Mario over the 
Rainbow. Again, the outlook is bleak:

5:05:44.760,5:05:48.000
90 speed would suffice, but it’s 
still nowhere near feasible.

5:05:48.539,5:05:51.060
The next A press left is in Jolly Roger Bay,

5:05:51.061,5:05:56.100
to collect the star Treasure of the Ocean 
Cave. This A press, as trivial as it is,

5:05:56.100,5:06:02.160
has been a total nightmare to try and save 
for over a decade. The star is 24 units too

5:06:02.160,5:06:06.480
high to be collected with a dive recover. 
The chests look like the obvious solution,

5:06:06.480,5:06:12.179
but they’re simple objects with a hitbox and no 
actual geometry. Mario can’t stand or bounce on

5:06:12.180,5:06:16.980
them. The star is at one of the highest points in 
the room, so it’s tricky to approach it otherwise.

5:06:16.980,5:06:22.560
It was found that given enough speed, Mario 
could in theory collect the star. Unfortunately,

5:06:22.561,5:06:28.199
this method requires about 260 speed, whereas the 
maximum speed that has been proven possible to

5:06:28.199,5:06:33.900
gain in the level is only about 180, using these 
pillars. Multiple ideas to build up more speed

5:06:33.900,5:06:38.820
were examined, but none of them were successful. 
The floating ship doesn’t have the right surface

5:06:38.820,5:06:43.920
for C-up sliding nor the right conditions for 
hyperspeed punching. This rock has a lot of

5:06:43.920,5:06:48.539
potential, but the conditions aren’t perfectly 
right to allow for hyperspeed of some kind.

5:06:48.539,5:06:52.320
Research is still ongoing to try 
to find new ways to build up speed,

5:06:52.320,5:06:57.900
or to try and lower the 260 requirement. No 
significant progress has been made in years.

5:06:58.680,5:07:03.299
Princess’s Secret Slide is in a similar 
boat, but much worse. While the star

5:07:03.299,5:07:07.561
you get for finishing the slide under 21 
seconds is low enough for a dive recover,

5:07:07.561,5:07:13.320
the star inside the box isn’t. The box itself can 
be broken with a dive recover, but then the star

5:07:13.320,5:07:18.959
is 31 units too high. There’s very little hope 
because the geometry of the room is so barren

5:07:18.959,5:07:23.939
that there simply isn’t anything to work with. If 
the star had been closer to the back of the room,

5:07:23.939,5:07:27.959
then it would have been reachable with 
VSC and a ground pound. Other than that,

5:07:27.959,5:07:31.980
there are a few pipe dreams like spawning 
displacement in the title screen demo,

5:07:31.980,5:07:37.199
but none of that is remotely close to work. In 
fact, the demo in Princess’s Secret Slide never

5:07:37.199,5:07:40.619
presses any buttons, so it couldn’t even 
break the box even if it had the chance.

5:07:40.619,5:07:46.439
Next up is Tiny-Huge Island. Here, the one 
star with remaining A presses is Wiggler’s

5:07:46.439,5:07:51.718
red coins. This, in fact, is one of two stars 
left in the game that requires two A presses

5:07:51.719,5:07:56.340
to get. The first one to clear this gap, 
and the second one to get on these pillars.

5:07:56.340,5:08:00.719
I’m repeating myself here, but again, this 
room just doesn’t have much to work with:

5:08:00.719,5:08:04.680
isolated platforms with large height 
disparities, no way to clone anything,

5:08:04.680,5:08:09.299
and just this one fire spitter. 
However, there is the floor above.

5:08:09.299,5:08:14.580
Here, you can find Wiggler running around and some 
coins. It’s not much better, but it’s something.

5:08:14.580,5:08:19.859
And, as it turns out, it is possible to use 
Wiggler to set up hyperspeed. Unfortunately,

5:08:19.859,5:08:26.160
no way was ever found to clip down into the red 
coins room, so that high speed is useless. Crazier

5:08:26.160,5:08:31.500
strategies were also looked at. Having Wiggler 
itself come down seems impossible and not even

5:08:31.500,5:08:36.660
helpful. A star dance clip could be good, if not 
for the only available coins being in unhelpful

5:08:36.660,5:08:41.039
locations, the need for a flame clone which is 
impossible, and for the 100-coin star already

5:08:41.039,5:08:46.379
being required to reach the mainland in the first 
place. Using sliding speed conservation to carry

5:08:46.379,5:08:50.760
hyperspeed into the red coins room seemed 
quite promising, but unlike a pause exit,

5:08:50.760,5:08:55.740
this map transition doesn’t preserve sliding 
speed. Ultimately, the search turned up fruitless.

5:08:56.340,5:09:01.320
The second star with two remaining A presses 
is Wing Mario over the Rainbow. And here,

5:09:01.320,5:09:06.179
we’ve got the most solid A press in the 
entire game. You can’t fly without an A

5:09:06.180,5:09:11.400
press. Mario can start flying in only three 
ways: with a triple jump, a cannon shot, or,

5:09:11.400,5:09:15.959
in this one specific exception, if he 
starts the level already flying. Due to

5:09:15.959,5:09:20.879
the nature of this level, collecting all the 
red coins without flying is unimaginable. So,

5:09:20.879,5:09:27.299
of the 14 A presses left, this is by far the one 
that’s the most absolutely sure to never be saved.

5:09:27.299,5:09:31.799
With that in mind, though, there have been 
some ideas thrown around to at least reduce

5:09:31.799,5:09:36.359
the star to a single cannon shot instead 
of two. The problem here is pretty simple:

5:09:36.359,5:09:40.138
from the start of the stage, you need to 
go to the bottom of the level to talk to

5:09:40.139,5:09:45.000
the pink bob-omb and activate the cannons. The 
lowest cannon is too low and too weak to shoot

5:09:45.000,5:09:49.680
Mario all the way up to the top of the stage, so 
one shot from the high cannon is also required,

5:09:49.680,5:09:55.139
for a total of two A presses. Note that entering 
the level takes one A press by itself, so you

5:09:55.139,5:10:00.480
can’t open the cannons and re-enter the stage. 
The only way would be by dying, but there’s no

5:10:00.480,5:10:05.699
way to take damage without an A press from this 
spot. Even assuming you could re-enter the stage

5:10:05.699,5:10:10.320
with the cannons already open, only the lowest 
cannon is accessible without an A press anyway.

5:10:10.320,5:10:15.599
There’s one more glimmer of hope. When 
Mario is flying against the edge of the map,

5:10:15.600,5:10:19.680
he’s actually able to build up speed. 
Unfortunately, the speed at which Mario

5:10:19.680,5:10:25.080
accelerates with this method is much too slow, and 
the wing cap has a limited timer. On top of that,

5:10:25.080,5:10:29.820
the timer can’t be refreshed because Mario 
can’t break boxes while flying unless he’s

5:10:29.820,5:10:34.138
flying very slowly. Therefore, there’s 
no way to build up meaningful speed,

5:10:34.139,5:10:38.100
because you’d constantly need to give up 
all that speed to refresh your flying timer.

5:10:38.879,5:10:43.080
Another level with two A presses is 
Shifting Sand Land. Here, though,

5:10:43.080,5:10:46.799
it’s just one A press, but repeated on 
two different stars: to get out of the

5:10:46.799,5:10:51.719
elevator for Inside the Ancient Pyramid and 
Pyramid Puzzle. The elevator is particularly

5:10:51.719,5:10:56.699
annoying because its walls are just 7 units 
too high for a dive recover to clear them.

5:10:56.699,5:11:01.260
There’s also the option of climbing the 
entire pyramid, which sounds terrible,

5:11:01.260,5:11:06.719
but surprisingly doesn’t look too bad. After 
a precise knockback bounce to warp past this

5:11:06.719,5:11:10.799
pole and a star dance clip to get up to 
here, things are looking up. But then,

5:11:10.799,5:11:15.299
all hope is lost when Mario faces 
another pole. With no warp available,

5:11:15.299,5:11:20.760
no helpful knockback source, and no way to 
clone anything, this A press seems unavoidable.

5:11:20.760,5:11:26.699
Specifically for Inside the Ancient Pyramid, 
things look even worse. A second A press is needed

5:11:26.699,5:11:31.439
to reach the star, although a star dance clip has 
been shown to work. Of course, you can only have

5:11:31.439,5:11:37.080
one star dance clip at once. The pole A press also 
serves to get on top of this grindel and clear the

5:11:37.080,5:11:42.240
next ledge. Without that jump, this little step 
just barely too high for a dive recover would

5:11:42.240,5:11:46.980
have to be cleared using an amp clip. These 
amps are unique: instead of going in a circle,

5:11:46.980,5:11:53.459
they chase Mario. This corner is just barely close 
enough to make an amp appear. With a clever lure,

5:11:53.459,5:11:58.320
it shocks Mario and he grabs the ledge, 
just like a star dance clip. Theoretically,

5:11:58.320,5:12:03.718
an amp clip could also get Mario up to the star, 
but it doesn’t work. In short, the amp might not

5:12:03.719,5:12:08.879
go that high up, and it won’t stay this far from 
its home long enough for a double amp clip. But

5:12:08.879,5:12:13.379
regardless, the problem is the pole. Without 
a way to get past the pole, nothing matters.

5:12:13.379,5:12:19.139
There is, however, one remote possibility 
involving Eyeroks. If an Eyerok is about to

5:12:19.139,5:12:22.740
pound the ground but it starts its movement 
while already touching the ground, it can

5:12:22.740,5:12:27.900
shoot upwards into infinity. This idea has some 
potential, but outside of hacking its position,

5:12:27.900,5:12:31.740
the Eyerok has never been made to 
enter this state. Even if it did,

5:12:31.740,5:12:36.060
though, it rises so fast that Mario would 
clip through it instead of being carried up.

5:12:36.061,5:12:41.039
Last but not least, this is perhaps 
the most infamous A press of them all:

5:12:41.039,5:12:47.100
the pole in Bowser in the Fire Sea. From the very 
beginning, Tyler Kehne’s primary focus was to

5:12:47.100,5:12:53.820
make a 70-star run in 0 A presses a reality. For 
over 7 years, this one A press has been the only

5:12:53.820,5:12:59.638
barrier between him and his goal. Even worse, 
it is actually possible to get past the pole,

5:12:59.639,5:13:03.959
but only on the Wii Virtual Console. But 
the fact that it’s an emulated re-release,

5:13:03.959,5:13:07.320
and its incompatibility with the 
Japanese N64 exclusive glitches,

5:13:07.320,5:13:12.179
have always tarnished the 0 A press full game run 
in the minds of Tyler Kehne and the ABC community.

5:13:12.180,5:13:17.580
A blueprint to make it possible on Nintendo 
64 has been in the works for years and years,

5:13:17.580,5:13:22.320
but several hurdles remain. The idea 
is actually similar to the Lethal Lava

5:13:22.320,5:13:27.000
Land strategy. It consists of supplying 
thousands of speed to one or more bullies,

5:13:27.000,5:13:31.500
then using squish cancel and the rotational 
displacement of one of these platforms to send

5:13:31.500,5:13:36.539
Mario up as he travels to a parallel universe. 
When he comes back, he’s now past the pole.

5:13:36.539,5:13:40.920
The setup is a bit more complex than 
in Lethal Lava Land. Here’s a rundown

5:13:40.920,5:13:44.520
of how it works - I’ll give you time to 
read it. It boils down to this problem:

5:13:44.520,5:13:48.180
the platform rotates because of 
Mario’s weight on it. As such,

5:13:48.180,5:13:52.139
the rotational displacement applied to 
Mario is almost always going to be negative.

5:13:52.680,5:13:57.180
Getting a positive displacement from this 
platform requires a sudden burst of speed that

5:13:57.180,5:14:01.859
isn’t possible to achieve with normal movement. 
The only currently known way to do it would

5:14:01.859,5:14:06.599
need three different bullies, all hovering at 
ludicrous speeds and pinpoint precise positions.

5:14:06.600,5:14:12.719
Only, there’s a single bully down here, so this 
cannot work. This theoretical solution was created

5:14:12.719,5:14:17.939
after years of work by Tyler Kehne. He did it by 
hacking the speed and position of each bully, and

5:14:17.939,5:14:22.859
its purpose is to serve as a demonstration that 
the idea of a PU speed squish cancel upwarp in

5:14:22.859,5:14:28.798
Bowser in the Fire Sea can work on paper given the 
right conditions. This wishful thinking would take

5:14:28.799,5:14:33.840
a massive leap towards reality if it was shown 
to be possible using only one hyperspeed bully.

5:14:33.840,5:14:39.359
And in fact, that’s exactly what happened just a 
week ago, when SpudY2K showed off a route using

5:14:39.359,5:14:44.519
the 10k glitch that would theoretically require a 
single bully. But despite the creation of multiple

5:14:44.520,5:14:48.959
different bruteforcers to try and find favourable 
conditions there’s still a lot of work to be done

5:14:48.959,5:14:55.619
to bring this idea to reality. This is the brick 
wall the ABC community needs to break through. The

5:14:55.619,5:15:00.180
actual bully battery is thought to be relatively 
trivial in comparison to this massive problem,

5:15:00.180,5:15:04.980
although it could take significantly longer 
than the mere 26 hours of Lethal Lava Land.

5:15:04.980,5:15:10.798
There are also four half A presses remaining in 
the run: one for Watch for Rolling Rocks to use

5:15:10.799,5:15:15.480
elevators with PU speed, two in Dire Dire 
Docks to swim with the shell for cloning,

5:15:15.480,5:15:20.039
and one for Get a Hand to kick the wall 
to set up spawning displacement. With

5:15:20.039,5:15:24.060
so many other A presses left, it seems 
very unlikely that we’ll ever run into

5:15:24.061,5:15:28.200
a situation where these half A presses 
become a problem for the 120-star run.

5:15:29.160,5:15:35.340
Here’s my own judgement of how likely each A press 
is to ever be saved. It’s entirely subjective,

5:15:35.340,5:15:40.379
and while I believe the gist of it is generally 
agreed on, the exact ordering is pure speculation.

5:15:40.379,5:15:46.799
Of all these A presses, the most likely to be 
saved is definitely Bowser in the Fire Sea. A

5:15:46.799,5:15:51.359
long way behind would be Jolly Roger Bay, then 
Shifting Sand Land and the second cannon of Wing

5:15:51.359,5:15:56.160
Mario over the Rainbow. Even less likely would 
be one of the two A presses in Tiny-Huge Island,

5:15:56.160,5:16:00.180
followed by all of the stage entries, with 
a slight favour towards Tick Tock Clock.

5:16:00.180,5:16:04.561
At rock bottom, you can find saving 
both A presses in Tiny-Huge Island,

5:16:04.561,5:16:09.299
the Princess Secret Slide box, and finally, the 
first cannon in Wing Mario over the Rainbow.

5:16:09.299,5:16:15.779
The final, perfectly optimized A press 
count might very well be 13. If we’re

5:16:15.779,5:16:20.699
slightly more optimistic, maybe 10 
or 11. If we’re wildly optimistic,

5:16:20.699,5:16:25.260
it could get down to about a handful. 
I see no possible scenario where the

5:16:25.260,5:16:30.480
entire game could ever get down to zero. But 
regardless of the final frontier of the ABC,

5:16:30.480,5:16:34.980
there will always be the endless secondary 
challenge of making the run faster and more

5:16:34.980,5:16:40.259
efficient. Over the years, countless improvements 
have been made that cut dozens of hours from the

5:16:40.260,5:16:45.359
total run time. A full 70-star run in 0 A 
presses has been in the works for years,

5:16:45.359,5:16:50.638
but it’s stuck waiting for Bowser in the Fire 
Sea to be solved on Nintendo 64. Meanwhile,

5:16:50.639,5:16:57.420
the estimated time for a 120-star run in 14 A 
presses is now 58 hours and 47 minutes. Over

5:16:57.420,5:17:02.160
two thirds of that can be attributed to Elevator 
Tour in the Volcano and Tick Tock Clock combined.

5:17:03.900,5:17:09.179
Over twenty-two years, the A Button Challenge has 
become the most fascinating video game endeavour

5:17:09.180,5:17:15.119
of all time. In 2000, when Alex Penev posed 
this challenge to a handful of friends on IRC,

5:17:15.119,5:17:19.799
he couldn’t even begin to imagine what would 
become of it. Neither would Curtis Bright,

5:17:19.799,5:17:24.299
who tried to turn it into a new form of 
competition on his website. His vision and

5:17:24.299,5:17:28.980
forward thinking to allow tool-assisted speedruns 
to compete on his board paved the way for the

5:17:28.980,5:17:34.798
revolutionary work of bobmario511, who set the 
baseline for years to come. At the same time,

5:17:34.799,5:17:39.180
Thiago Trujillo attacked the real-time version 
of the challenge almost all on his own,

5:17:39.180,5:17:43.619
an achievement that, to this day, is 
still underrated. But by all means,

5:17:43.619,5:17:49.680
this amazing adventure would have never happened 
without the now legendary pannenkoek2012.

5:17:49.680,5:17:53.939
His incredible work on the A Button 
Challenge inspired multiple generations,

5:17:53.939,5:17:59.759
coming in waves over the next 9 years. First 
came Plush, Gaehne D. and sonicpacker who

5:17:59.760,5:18:05.160
supplemented Pannen’s work with novel ideas. 
Then Tyler Kehne, whose fresh outlook brought

5:18:05.160,5:18:09.719
three major trick discoveries that shaved 
off dozens of A presses, and bad_boot,

5:18:09.719,5:18:14.820
who not only made key discoveries, but also 
rekindled the real-time ABC. In recent years,

5:18:14.820,5:18:19.859
Marbler took the complexity level to a new 
galaxy, helped by the involvement of talented

5:18:19.859,5:18:26.820
and dedicated problem solvers like Iwer Sonsch, 
ds273, and SJMHRP. The team has evolved so much,

5:18:26.820,5:18:32.340
but at its core, the infallible Pannenkoek remains 
the captain of the mission. His commitment to the

5:18:32.340,5:18:37.379
journey and his undying resilience continue to 
amaze hundreds of thousands of people to this day.

5:18:38.219,5:18:43.859
The legacy left by Pannenkoek and the A Button 
Challenge cannot be overstated. It inspired

5:18:43.859,5:18:48.959
so many other game communities to do the same. 
Just to name a few, pretty much all of the Mario

5:18:48.959,5:18:54.359
games. The 2D Mario games would seem boring at a 
glance, but they’re actually full of surprises.

5:18:54.959,5:18:59.639
Super Mario World is especially interesting, 
considering that all 96 exits can be done

5:18:59.639,5:19:05.820
in only 24 A or B presses. More recently, the 
New Super Mario Bros. Wii jumpless challenge,

5:19:05.820,5:19:11.759
done by Adeal, is getting a lot of attention. 
Super Mario Sunshine and both Galaxy games have

5:19:11.760,5:19:16.561
to waste hundreds of A presses in menus, but they 
are quite optimized in terms of actual gameplay.

5:19:17.219,5:19:20.820
Most 3D Sonic games also have 
an A Button Challenge - in fact,

5:19:20.820,5:19:26.939
Shadow the Hedgehog was beaten entirely in 0 
A presses by RingRush. The Donkey Kong 64 ABC,

5:19:26.939,5:19:32.279
which is also led by RingRush, is absolutely 
full of clever solutions and goofy tricks. Its

5:19:32.279,5:19:36.840
sister games Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie both 
have A Button Challenges of their own as well.

5:19:36.840,5:19:42.719
The Super Mario 64 ABC also inspired a myriad 
of more or less loosely related challenges,

5:19:42.719,5:19:46.680
such as the B and Z button challenges, 
the no buttons challenge and the no

5:19:46.680,5:19:50.879
joystick challenge. Even in other games 
like Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask,

5:19:50.879,5:19:55.680
any% low pauses or All Dungeons no doors, 
beating Sonic 3 without pressing right,

5:19:55.680,5:20:00.660
and half of Ceave Gaming’s YouTube 
channel. The list is absolutely endless.

5:20:01.619,5:20:10.080
So, this is it. This is the current state of the 
A button challenge. 14 A presses remain. Dozens

5:20:10.080,5:20:14.939
of blueprints exist to try and save them. One of 
them is being actively worked on and is thought

5:20:14.939,5:20:22.199
to be possible. Only one. After all these years, 
the community has finally hit a wall. With all

5:20:22.199,5:20:26.099
its dead ends, the current outlook for the 
future of the A Button Challenge does look

5:20:26.100,5:20:31.920
a bit grim. But the community around it keeps 
growing. Over the years, the entire Super Mario

5:20:31.920,5:20:36.959
64 code was fully decompiled. Countless 
simulators were written to investigate

5:20:36.959,5:20:43.260
billions and billions of possibilities. There’s 
still work ahead of us. There might always be.

5:20:44.160,5:20:51.000
Mount Everest wasn’t designed to be climbable. 
Mountains don’t care if anyone manages to reach

5:20:51.000,5:20:56.520
the top or not. Super Mario 64 was never 
designed to be beaten with zero A presses.

5:20:56.520,5:21:03.360
The game doesn’t care if it’s possible. We do. 
And until we reach the top, we will keep climbing.
